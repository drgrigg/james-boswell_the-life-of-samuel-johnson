<h2>TITLES OF MANY OF THE WORKS
QUOTED IN THE NOTES.</h2>

<p>In my notes I have often given but brief references to the authors whom
I quote. The following list, which is not, however, so complete as I
could wish, will, I hope, do much towards supplying the deficiency.
Most of the poets, and a few of the prose writers also, I have not
found it needful to include, as my references apply equally well to
all editions of their works. The date in each case shows, not the
year of the original publication, but of the edition to which I have
referred.</p>

<h2>ADDENDA</h2>

<p>Last summer Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson sold some very interesting
autograph letters written by Johnson to William Strahan, the printer.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to find that the purchasers, with but one
exception, were mindful of what Boswell so well describes as 'the general
courtesy of literature[1],' and were ready to place their treasures
at my service. To one of them, Mr. Frederick Barker, of 43, Rowan Road,
Brook Green, I am still more indebted, for he entrusted me not only with
the original letters which he had just bought, but also with some others
that he had previously possessed. His Johnsonian collection is one of
unusual interest. I have moreover to acknowledge my obligations to
Mr. Fawcett, of 14, King Street, Covent Garden; to Messrs. J. Pearson
and Co., of 46, Pall Mall; to Messrs. Robson and Kerslake, of Coventry
Street, Haymarket; to Mr. Frank T. Sabin, of 10 and 12, Garrick Street,
Covent Garden; and to Mr. John Waller, of 2, Artesian Road, Westbourne
Grove. Those of the letters which are undated, I have endeavoured to
assign to their proper places by internal evidence. The absence of a
date is in itself very strong evidence that they belong to a comparatively
early period (see <i>ante</i>, i. 122, n. 2).</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: Ante, iv. 246.]</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p><i>A letter about a projected Geographical Dictionary by Mr. Bathurst, with
Bathurst's Proposal; dated March 22, probably written in 1753</i>.[In the
possession of Mr. Frederick Barker, of 43, Rowan Road, Brook Green.]</p>

<h5>'SIR,</h5>

<p>'I have inclosed the Scheme which I mentioned yesterday in which the work
proposed is sufficiently explained.</p>

<p>'The Undertaker, Mr. Bathurst, is a Physician of the University of
Cambridge, of about eight years standing, and will perform the work in
such a manner as may satisfy the publick. No advice of mine will be
wanting, but advice will be all that I propose to contribute unless it
should be thought worth while that I should write a preface, which if
desired I will do and put my name to it. The terms which I am commissioned
to offer are these:</p>

<p>'1. A guinea and half shall be paid for each sheet of the copy.</p>

<p>'2. The authour will receive a Guinea and half a week from the date of
the Contract.</p>

<p>'3. As it is certain that many books will be necessary, the Authour will
at the end of the work take the books furnished him in part of payment
at prime Cost, which will be a considerable reduction of the price of
the Copy; or if it seems as you thought yesterday no reduction, he will
allow out of the last payment fifty pounds for the use of the Books and
return them.</p>

<p>'4. In two months after his first demand of books shall be supplied,
he purposes to write three Sheets a week and to continue the same
quantity to the end of the work, unless he shall be hindered by want of
Books. He does not however expect to be always able to write according
to the order of the Alphabet but as his Books shall happen to supply him,
and therefore cannot send any part to the press till the whole is nearly
finished.</p>

<p>'5. He undertakes as usual the Correction.</p>

<p>'I am, Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>
</p>

<p>'March 22nd.<br/>

'To Mr. Strahan.'<br/>
</p>

<h5>'PROPOSAL.</h5>

<p>'There is nothing more apparently wanting to the English Literature,
than a Geographical Dictionary, which, though its use is almost every day
necessary, not only to Men of Study, but of Trade or publick employment,
yet has been hitherto, not only unperformed, but almost unattempted
among us. Bohun's Dictionary, the only one which has any pretension to
regard, owes that pretension only to its bulk; for it is in all parts
contemptibly defective and is therefore deservedly forgotten. In
Collier's Dictionary, what Geography there is, can scarcely be found
among the crowd of other subjects, and when it is found, is of no great
importance. The books of Eachard and Salmon, though useful for the ends
proposed by them, are too small to be considered as anticipations of this
work, which is intended to consist of two volumes of the same size and
print with Harris's Dictionary, in which will be comprised the following
particulars:</p>

<p>'The situation of every Country with its Provinces and dependencies
according to its present state, and latest observation.</p>

<p>'The description of all remarkable Cities, Towns, Castles, Fortresses,
and places observable for their situation, products or other particulars.</p>

<p>'An account of the considerable Rivers, their Springs, Branches, Course,<br/>

Outlets, how far navigable, the Produce and Qualities of their waters.<br/>
</p>

<p>'The course of Voyages, giving directions to sailors for navigating
from one place of the World to another, with particular attention
to the Traffic of these Kingdoms.</p>

<p>'An account of all the principal Ports and Harbours of the known World,
in which will be laid down the Pilotage, Bearings, depth of water,
danger from Sands or Rocks, firmness or uncertainty of Anchorage, and
degree of safety from particular Winds.</p>

<p>'An exact account of the Commodities of each Country, both natural and
artificial.</p>

<p>'A description of the remarkable Animals in every Country, whether<br/>

Beasts, Birds or Fishes.<br/>
</p>

<p>'An account of the Buildings, whether ancient or modern, and of Ruins
or other remains of Antiquity.</p>

<p>'Remarks upon the soil, air, and waters of particular Places, their
several qualities and effects, the accidents to which every Region is
exposed, as Earthquakes and Hurricanes, and the diseases peculiar to
the Inhabitants or incident to strangers at their arrival.</p>

<p>'The political State of the World, the Government of Countries, and the<br/>

Magistracy of Cities, with their particular Laws, or Privileges.<br/>
</p>

<p>'The most probable and authentic Calculations of the number of Inhabitants
of each place.</p>

<p>'The military state of Countries, their Forces, manner of making War,<br/>

Weapons, and naval Power.<br/>
</p>

<p>'The Commercial State, extent of their Trade, Number and strength of
their Colonies, quantity of Shipping.</p>

<p>'The pretensions of Princes with their Alliances, Relations and<br/>

Genealogies.<br/>
</p>

<p>'The customs of Nations with regard to Trade, and receptions of strangers,
their domestic Customs, as Rites of Marriage and Burial. Their particular
Laws. Their habits, recreations and amusements.</p>

<p>'The religious Opinions of all Nations.</p>

<p>'These and many other heads of observation will be collected, not merely
from the Dictionaries now extant in many Languages, but from the best
Surveys, Local Histories, Voyages, and particular accounts[1], among
which care will be taken to select those of the best authority, as the
basis of the Work, and to extract from them such observations as may
best promote Knowledge and gratify Enquiry, so that it is to be hoped,
there will be few remarkable places in the known World, of which the
Politician, the Merchant, the Sailor, or the Man of Curiosity may not
find a useful and pleasing account, of the credit of which the Reader
may always judge, as the Authors from whom it is taken will be regularly
quoted, a caution which if some, who have attempted such general works,
had observed, their labours would have deserved, and found more favour
from the Publick.'</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: That this is done will appear from the authours' names
exactly quoted.]</p>

<p>This letter must have been written about the year 1753, for Bathurst
is described as a physician of about eight years' standing. He took
his degree as Bachelor of Medicine at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1745,
and did not, it should seem, proceed to the higher degree. In 1757
he was at the Havannah, where he died (<i>ante</i>, i. 242, n. i). He was
Johnson's beloved friend, of whom 'he hardly ever spoke without tears
in his eyes' (<i>ante</i>, i. 190, n. 2). The Proposal, I have no doubt,
was either written, or at all events revised, by Johnson. It is quite
in his style. It may be assumed that it is in Bathurst's handwriting.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<p><i>An apologetical letter about some work that was passing through the
press; undated, but probably written about the years 1753-5</i>.[In the
possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>

<h4>'DEAR SIR,</h4>

<p>'What you tell me I am ashamed never to have thought on‚ÄîI wish I had
known it sooner‚ÄîSend me back the last sheet; and the last copy for

<h5>'SAM. JOHNSON.'</h5>

<p>'To Mr. Strahan.'</p>

<p>In all likelihood Johnson is writing about the Dictionary. The absence
of a date, as I have already said, is strong evidence that the letter
was written comparatively early. As the first edition of the Dictionary
was in folio a sheet consisted of four pages. Johnson writing on April
3, 1753 says, 'I began the second vol. of my Dictionary, room being left
in the first for Preface, Grammar, and History, none of them yet begun'
(<i>ante</i>, i. 255). As the book was published on April 15, 1755 (<i>ante</i>,
i. 290, n. 1), the printing must have gone on very rapidly, when a
start was once made. By <i>copy</i> he means his <i>manuscript for printing</i>.</p>

<h5>III, IV.</h5>

<p><i>Two undated letters about printing the Dictionary</i>.[In the possession
of Mr. John Waller, 2, Artesian Road, Westbourne Grove.]</p>

<h5>'DEAR SIR,</h5>

<p>'I must desire you to add to your other civilities this one, to go to
Mr. Millar and represent to him the manner of going on, and inform him
that I know not how to manage. I pay three and twenty shillings a week
to my assistants, in each instance having much assistance from them,
but they tell me they shall be able to pull better in method, as indeed
I intend they shall. The Point is to get two Guineas.</p>

<p>'Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>

(Address on back.) 'To Mr. Strahan.'<br/>
</p>

<h5>'SIR,</h5>

<p>'I have often suspected that it is as you say, and have told Mr. Dodsley
of it. It proceeds from the haste of the amanuensis to get to the end
of his day's work. I have desired the passages to be clipped close, and
then perhaps for two or three leaves it is done. But since poor Stuart's
time I could never get that part of the work into regularity, and
perhaps never shall. I will try to take some more care but can promise
nothing; when I am told there is a sheet or two I order it away. You
will find it sometimes close; when I make up any myself, which never
happens but when I have nobody with me, I generally clip it close, but
one cannot always be on the watch.</p>

<p>'I am Sir, Your most, &amp;c.<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>
</p>

<p>These letters refer to the printing of the <i>Dictionary</i>, of which
Dodsley and Millar were two among the proprietors, and Strahan the
printer. Francis Stuart or Stewart was one of Johnson's amanuenses
(<i>ante</i>, i. 187). In 1779 Johnson paid his sister a guinea for an old
pocket-book of her brother's (<i>ante</i>, iii. 418), and wrote on April
8,1780 (<i>ante</i>, iii. 421):‚Äî'The memory of her brother is yet fresh
in my mind; he was an ingenious and worthy man.' In February 1784 he
gave her another guinea for a letter relating to himself that he had
found in the pocket-book (<i>ante</i>, iv. 262). A writer in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>
for 1799, p. 1171, who had been employed in Strahan's printing-works,
says that 'Stewart was useful to Johnson in the explanation of low cant
phrases; all words relating to gambling and card-playing, such as
<i>All-Fours</i>, <i>Catch-honours</i> [not in Johnson's Dictionary], <i>Cribbage</i>
[merely defined as <i>A game at cards</i>], were said to be Stewart's
corrected by the Doctor.' He adds that after the printing had gone
on some time 'the proprietors of the <i>Dictionary</i> paid Johnson through
Mr. Strahan at the rate of a guinea for every sheet of MS. copy delivered.
The copy was written upon quarto post, and in two columns each page.
Johnson wrote in his own hand the words and their explanation, and
generally two or three words in each column, leaving a space between
each for the authorities, which were pasted on as they were collected
by the different amanuenses employed: and in this mode the MS. was so
regular that the sheets of MS. which made a sheet of print could be
very exactly ascertained.' The same writer states that Stewart in a
night ramble in Edinburgh with some of his drinking companions 'met with
the mob conducting Captain Porteous to be hanged; they were next day
examined about it before the Town Council, when, as Stewart used to say,
"we were found to be too drunk to have any hand in the business." He
gave an accurate account of it in the Edinburgh Magazine of that time.'</p>

<p><i>A letter about Miss Williams, taxes due, and a journey; undated, but
perhaps written at Oxford in 1754</i>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick
Barker.]</p>

<h4>'SIR,</h4>

<p>'I shall not be long here, but in the mean time if Miss Williams wants
any money pray speak to Mr. Millar and supply her, they write to me
about some taxes which I wish you would pay.</p>

<p>'My journey will come to very little beyond the satisfaction of knowing
that there is nothing to be done, and that I leave few advantages here
to those that shall come after me.</p>

<p>'I am Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<h5>'SAM. JOHNSON.'</h5>

<p>'My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>

<p>To Mr. Strahan.'</p>

<p>Miss Williams came to live with Johnson after his wife's death in 1752
(<i>ante</i>, i. 232). The fact that Strahan is asked to supply her with
money after speaking to Mr. Millar seems to show that this letter was
written some time before the publication of the <i>Dictionary</i> in April
1755. Millar 'took the principal charge of conducting its publication,'
and Johnson 'had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a
considerable time before he had finished his task' (<i>ante</i>, i. 287).</p>

<p>His 'journey' may have been his visit to Oxford in the summer of 1754.
He went there, because, 'I cannot,' he said, 'finish my book [the
Dictionary] to my mind without visiting the libraries' (<i>ante</i>, i. 270).
According to Thomas Warton 'he collected nothing in the libraries for
his <i>Dictionary</i>' (<i>ib</i> n. 5). It is perhaps to this failure that the
latter part of the letter refers, Johnson's visit, however, was one of
five weeks, while the first line of the letter shews that he intended
to be away from London but a short time.</p>

<h5>VI.</h5>

<p><i>A letter about 'Rasselas,' dated</i> Jan. 20, 1759.[In the possession of
Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>

<p>'When I was with you last night I told you of a story which I was
preparing for the press. The title will be</p>

<p>"The Choice of Life</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>The History of ‚Ä¶ Prince of Abissinia."</p>

<p>'It will make about two volumes like little Pompadour, that is about
one middling volume. The bargain which I made with Mr. Johnson was
seventy five pounds (or guineas) a volume, and twenty five pounds for
the second edition. I will sell this either at that price or for sixty[2],
the first edition of which he shall himself fix the number, and the
property then to revert to me, or for forty pounds, and I have the
profit that is retain half the copy. I shall have occasion for thirty
pounds on Monday night when I shall deliver the book which I must
entreat you upon such delivery to procure me. I would have it offered
to Mr. Johnson, but have no doubt of selling it, on some of the terms
mentioned.</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: 'Fifty-five pounds' written first and then scored over.]</p>

<p>'I will not print my name, but expect it to be known.<br/>

I am Dear Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>

SAM. JOHNSON.<br/>

Jan. 20, 1759.<br/>

Get me the money if you can.'<br/>
</p>

<p>This letter is of unusual interest, as it proves beyond all doubt that
<i>Rasselas</i> was written some weeks before <i>Candide</i> was published (see
<i>ante</i>, i. 342, n. a). Baretti, as I have shewn (i. 341, n. 3), says
that 'any other person with the degree of reputation Johnson then
possessed would have got ¬£400 for the work, but he never understood
the art of making the most of his productions.' We see, however, by
this letter that Johnson did ask for a larger sum than the booksellers
allowed him. He received but one hundred pounds for the first edition,
but he had made a bargain for one hundred and fifty pounds or guineas.
Johnson, the bookseller, seems to have been but in a small way of
business as a publisher. I do not find in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for 1758 any advertisement of books published by him, and only one in
1759 (P. 339). Cowper's publisher in 1778 was Joseph Johnson of St.
Paul's Churchyard. (Cowper's <i>Works</i> by Southey, i. 285; see also
Nichols' <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, iii. 461-464.)</p>

<p>By 'little Pompadour' Johnson, no doubt, means the second and cheaper
edition of <i>The History of the Marchioness de Pompadour</i>. The first
edition was published by Hooper in one volume, price five shillings
(<i>Gent. Mag</i>. for October 1758, p. 493). and the second in two volumes
for three shillings and sixpence (<i>Gent. Mag</i>. for November, 1758,
p. 543).</p>

<p>Johnson did not generally 'print his name.' He published anonymously his
translation of <i>Lobos Voyage to Abyssinia; London; The Life of Savage;
The Rambler</i>, and <i>The Idler</i>, both in separate numbers and when
collected in volumes; <i>Rasselas; The False Alarm; Falkland's Islands;
The Patriot;</i>, and <i>Taxation no Tyranny</i>; (when these four pamphlets
were collected in a volume he published them with the title of <i>Political
Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler</i>). He gave his name in <i>The Vanity
of Human Wishes, Irene</i>, the <i>Dictionary</i>, his edition of <i>Shakespeare</i>,
the <i>Journey to the Western Islands</i>, and the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>.</p>

<p><i>A letter about George Strahan's election to a scholarship at University
College, Oxford, and about William Strahan's 'affair with the University';
dated October 24, 1764</i>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>

<h4>'SIR,</h4>

<p>'I think I have pretty well disposed of my young friend George, who, if
you approve of it, will be entered next Monday a Commoner of University
College, and will be chosen next day a Scholar of the House. The
Scholarship is a trifle, but it gives him a right, upon a vacancy, to
a Fellowship of more than sixty pounds a year if he resides, and I
suppose of more than forty if he takes a Curacy or small living. The
College is almost filled with my friends, and he will be well treated.
The Master is informed of the particular state of his education, and
thinks, what I think too, that for Greek he must get some private
assistance, which a servitour of the College is very well qualified
and will be very willing to afford him on very easy terms.</p>

<p>'I must desire your opinion of this scheme by the next post, for the
opportunity will be lost if we do not now seize it, the Scholarships
being necessarily filled up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I depend on your proposed allowance of a hundred a year, which must
the first year be a little enlarged because there are some extraordinary
expenses, as</p>

<p>Caution (which is allowed in his last quarter). .     7 0 0
Thirds. (He that enters upon a room pays two
thirds of the furniture that he finds, and
receives from his successor two thirds of what
he pays; so that if he pays ¬£20 he receives
¬£13 6s. 8d., this perhaps may be)                    12  0 0
Fees at entrance, matriculation &amp;c., perhaps          2  0 0
His gown (I think)                                    2 10 0
                                                     ________
                                                   ¬£ 23 10 0</p>

<p>'If you send us a Bill for about thirty pounds we shall set out
commodiously enough. You should fit him out with cloaths and linen,
and let him start fair, and it is the opinion of those whom I consult,
that with your hundred a year and the petty scholarship he may live
with great ease to himself, and credit to you.</p>

<p>'Let me hear as soon as is possible.</p>

<p>'In your affair with the university, I shall not be consulted, but I
hear nothing urged against your proposal.</p>

<p>'I am, Sir,<br/>

'Your humble servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>
</p>

<p>'Oct. 24, 1764.</p>

<p>'My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>

<p>'To Mr. Strahan, Printer, in New Street, Shoe-lane, London.'</p>

<p>My friend, Mr. C. J. Faulkner, Fellow and Tutor of University College,
has given me the following extracts from the College records:‚Äî</p>

<p>'Oct. 30-31, 1764. Candidatis examinatis electi sunt Gulielmus Jones
et Georgius Strahan in vacuas Exhibitiones Dmi Simonis Benet Baronetti.'</p>

<p>Gulielmus Jones is the famous oriental scholar, Sir William Jones, whose
portrait adorns the Hall of his ancient College (<i>ante</i>, ii. 25, n. 2).</p>

<p>On April 16, 1767, is found the election of 'Georgium Strahan, sophistam
in perpetuum hujus Collegii Socium.'</p>

<p>He vacated his fellowship in 1773.</p>

<p>The value of a Bennet scholarship in 1764 was ten pounds a year, with
rooms added, the rent of which was reckoned as equal to two pounds more.
A fellowship on the same foundation was worth about twenty pounds, with
a yearly dividend added to it that amounted to about thirty pounds.
'Fines' (<i>ante</i>, iii. 323) and other extra payments might easily raise
the value to more than sixty pounds.</p>

<p>The 'caution' is the sum deposited by an undergraduate with the College
Bursar or Steward as a security for the payment of his 'battells' or
account. Johnson in 1728 had to pay at Pembroke College the same sum
(seven pounds) that George Strahan in 1764 had to pay at University
College. <i>Ante</i>, i. 58, n. 2.</p>

<p>Johnson wrote four letters to George Strahan, when he was a boy at
school, and one letter when he was at College. (See Croker's <i>Johnson</i>,
pp. 129, 130, 161, 168.) In this last letter, dated May 25, 1765, he
writes: 'Do not tire yourself so much with Greek one day as to be afraid
of looking on it the next; but give it a certain portion of time,
suppose four hours, and pass the rest of the day in Latin or English.
I would have you learn French, and take in a literary journal once a
month, which will accustom you to various subjects, and inform you what
learning is going forward in the world. Do not omit to mingle some
lighter books with those of more importance; that which is read <i>remisso
animo</i> is often of great use, and takes great hold of the remembrance.
However, take what course you will, if you be diligent you will be a
scholar.'</p>

<p>George Strahan attended Johnson on his death-bed, and published the
volume called <i>Prayers and Meditations composed by Samuel Johnson</i>.
<i>Ante</i>, i. 235, n. i; iv. 376, n. 4.</p>

<p>William Strahan's 'affair with the University' was very likely connected
with the lease of the University Printing House. From the 'Orders of
the Delegates of the Press,' 1758, I have been permitted to copy the
following entry, which bears a date but six days later than that of
Johnson's letter.</p>

<p>'Tuesday, Oct. 30, 1764. At a meeting of the Delegates of the Press.</p>

<p>'Ordered,</p>

<p>'That the following articles be made the foundation of the new lease
to be granted of the moiety of the Printing House; that a copy of them
be delivered to Mr. Baskett and Mr. Eyre, and that they be desired to
give in their respective proposals at a meeting to be held on Tuesday
the sixth of November.' (P. 41.)</p>

<p>The chief part of the lease consisted of the privilege to print Bibles
and Prayer Books. I conjecture that Strahan had hoped to get a share in
the lease.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><i>A letter about a cancel in Johnson's 'Journey to the Western Islands
of Scotland', dated Nov. 30</i>, 1774.[In the possession of Messrs. Pearson
and Co., 46, Pall Mall.]</p>

<h4>'SIR,</h4>

<p>'I waited on you this morning having forgotten your new engagement; for
this you must not reproach me, for if I had looked upon your present
station with malignity I could not have forgotten it. I came to consult
you upon a little matter that gives me some uneasiness. In one of the
pages there is a severe censure of the clergy of an English Cathedral
which I am afraid is just, but I have since recollected that from me
it may be thought improper, for the Dean did me a kindness about forty
years ago. He is now very old, and I am not young. Reproach can do
him no good, and in myself I know not whether it is zeal or wantonness.
Can a leaf be cancelled without too much trouble? tell me what I shall
do. I have no settled choice, but I would not wish to allow the charge.
To cancel it seems the surer side. Determine for me.</p>

<p>'I am, Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>

'Nov. 30, 1774.<br/>
</p>

<p>'Tell me your mind: if you will cancel it I will write something to fill
up the vacuum. Please to direct to the borough.'</p>

<p>Mr. Strahan's 'new engagement' was in the House of Commons at Westminster,<br/>

to which he had been elected for the first time as member for Malmesbury.<br/>

The new Parliament had met on Nov. 29, the day before the date of<br/>

Johnson's letter (<i>Parl. Hist</i>, xviii. 23).<br/>
</p>

<p>The leaf that Johnson cancelled contained pages 47, 48 in the first
edition of his <i>Journey to the Western Islands</i>. It corresponds with
pages 19-30 in vol. ix. of Johnson's <i>Works</i> (ed. 1825), beginning
with the words 'could not enter,' and ending 'imperfect constitution.'
The excision is marked by a ridge of paper, which was left that the
revised leaf might be attached to it. Johnson describes how the lead
which covered the Cathedrals of Elgin and Aberdeen had been stripped
off by the order of the Scottish Council, and shipped to be sold in
Holland. He continues:‚Äî'Let us not however make too much haste to
despise our neighbours. Our own cathedrals are mouldering by unregarded
dilapidation. It seems to be part of the despicable philosophy of the
time to despise monuments of sacred magnificence, and we are in danger
of doing that deliberately,  which the Scots did not do but in the
unsettled state of an imperfect constitution.'</p>

<p>In the copy of the first edition in the Bodleian Library, which had
belonged to Gough the antiquary, there is written in his hand, as a
foot-note to 'neighbours': 'There is now, as I have heard, a body
of men not less decent or virtuous than the Scottish Council, longing
to melt the lead of an English Cathedral. What they shall melt, it
were just that they should swallow.' It can scarcely be doubted that
this is the suppressed passage. The English Cathedral to which Johnson
refers was, I believe, Lichfield. 'The roof,' says Harwood (History of
Lichfield, p. 75), 'was formerly covered with lead, but now with slate.'
Addenbroke, who had been Dean since 1745, was, we may assume, very old
at the time when Johnson wrote. I had at first thought it not unlikely
that it was Dr. Thomas Newton, Dean of St. Paul's and Bishop of Bristol,
who was censured. He was a Lichfield man, and was known to Johnson (see
<i>ante</i>, iv. 285, n. 3). He was, however, only seventy years old. I am
informed moreover by the Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson, the learned editor
of <i>Documents illustrating the History of St. Paul's</i>, that it is
very improbable that at this time the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's
entertained such a thought.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. C. E. Doble has kindly furnished me with the following
curious parallel to Johnson's suppressed wish about the molten lead.</p>

<p>'The chappell of our Lady [at Wells], late repayred by Stillington,
a place of great reverence and antiquitie, was likewise defaced, and
such was their thirst after lead (I would they had drunke it scalding)
that they tooke the dead bodies of bishops out of their leaden coffins,
and cast abroad the carkases skarce throughly putrified.'‚ÄîHarington's
<i>Nuga Antiquae</i>, ii. 147 (ed. 1804).</p>

<p>In the postscript Johnson says 'Please to direct to the borough.' He
was staying in Mr. Thrale's town-house in the Borough of Southwark.

<p><i>A letter about apprenticing a lad to Mr. Strahan, and about a
presentation to the Blue Coat School, dated December 22</i>, 1774. [In

Haymarket.]</p>

<p>'Sir,</p>

<p>'When we meet we talk, and I know not whether I always recollect what<br/>

I thought I had to say.<br/>
</p>

<p>'You will please to remember that I once asked you to receive an
apprentice, who is a scholar, and has always lived in a clergyman's
house, but who is mishapen, though I think not so as to hinder him
at the case. It will be expected that I should answer his Friend
who has hitherto maintained him, whether I can help him to a place.
He can give no money, but will be kept in cloaths.</p>

<p>'I have another request which it is perhaps not immediately in your
power to gratify. I have a presentation to beg for the blue coat
hospital. The boy is a non-freeman, and has both his parents living.
We have a presentation for a freeman which we can give in exchange.
If in your extensive acquaintance you can procure such an exchange,
it will be an act of great kindness. Do not let the matter slip out
of your mind, for though I try others I know not any body of so much
power to do it.</p>

<p>'I am, Sir, Your most humble Servant,</p>

<h5>'SAM. JOHNSON.'</h5>

<p>'Dec. 22, 1774.'</p>

<p>The apprentice was young William Davenport, the orphan son of a clergyman.<br/>

His friend was the Rev. W. Langley, the master of Ashbourne School.<br/>

Strahan received him as an apprentice (<i>ante</i>, ii. 334, n. i). See also<br/>

<p><i>A letter about suppressions in 'Taxation no Tyranny! dated March 1,

Covent Garden.]</p>

<h4>'SIR,</h4>

<p>'I am sorry to see that all the alterations proposed are evidences of
timidity. You may be sure that I do [? not] wish to publish, what those
for whom I write do not like to have published. But print me half a
dozen copies in the original state, and lay them up for me. It concludes
well enough as it is.</p>

<p>'When you print it, if you print it, please to frank one to me here, and
frank another to Mrs. Aston at Stow Hill, Lichfield.</p>

<p>'The changes are not for the better, except where facts were mistaken.
The last paragraph was indeed rather contemptuous, there was once more
of it which I put out myself.</p>

<p>'I am Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>
</p>

<p>'March 1, 1775.'</p>

<p>This letter refers to <i>Taxation no Tyranny</i>, which was published before
March 31, 1775, the date of Boswell's arrival in London (<i>ante</i>, ii.
311). Boswell says that he had in his possession 'a few proof leaves
of it marked with corrections in Johnson's own hand-writing' (ib. p.
313). Johnson, he says,' owned to me that it had been revised and
curtailed by some of those who were then in power.' When Johnson writes
'when you print it, if you print it,' he uses, doubtless, <i>print</i> in
the sense of <i>striking off copies</i>. The pamphlet was, we may assume, in
type before it was revised by 'those in power.' The corrections had been
made in the proof-sheets. Johnson asks to have six copies laid by for
him in the state in which he had wished to publish it. It seems that the
last paragraph had been struck out by the reviser, for Johnson says 'it
was rather contemptuous.' He does not think it needful to supply anything
in its place, for he says 'it concludes well enough as it is.'</p>

<p>Mr. Strahan had the right, as a member of Parliament, to frank all
letters and packets. That is to say, by merely writing his signature on
the cover he could pass them through the post free of charge. Johnson,
when he wrote to Scotland, used to employ him to frank his letters,
'that he might have the consequence of appearing a parliament-man among
his countrymen' (<i>ante</i>, iii. 364). It was to Oxford that a copy of the
pamphlet was to be franked to Johnson. That he was there at the time is
shown by a letter from him in Mrs. Piozzi's <i>Collection</i> (vol. i. p.
212), dated 'University College, Oxford, March 3, 1775.' Writing to her,
evidently from Bolt Court, on February 3, he had said: 'My pamphlet has
not gone on at all' (ib. i. 211). Mrs. Aston (or rather Miss Aston) is
mentioned <i>ante</i>, ii. 466.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p><i>A letter about 'copy' and a book by Professor Watson, dated Oct. 14,
1776'</i>.[In the possession of Mr. H. Fawcett, of 14, King Street, Covent
Garden.]</p>

<h4>'SIR,</h4>

<p>'I wrote to you about ten days ago, and sent you some copy. You have
not written again, that is a sorry trick.</p>

<p>'I am told that you are printing a Book for Mr. Professor Watson of
Saint Andrews, if upon any occasion, I can give any help, or be of any
use, as formerly in Dr. Robertson's publication, I hope you will make
no scruple to call upon me, for I shall be glad of an opportunity to
show that my reception at Saint Andrews has not been forgotten.</p>

<p>'I am Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'<br/>
</p>

<p>'Oct. 14, 1776.'</p>

<p>The' copy' or MS. that Johnson sent is, I conjecture, <i>Proposals for
the Rev. Mr. Shaw's Analysis of the Scotch Celtick Language</i> (<i>ante</i>,
iii. 107). This is the only acknowledged piece of writing of his during
1776. The book printing for Professor Watson was <i>History of the Reign
of Philip II</i>, which was published by Strahan and Cadell in 1777. This
letter is of unusual interest, as showing that Johnson had been of some
service as regards one of Robertson's books. It is possible that he
read some of the proof-sheets, and helped to get rid of the Scotticisms.
'Strahan,' according to Beattie, 'had corrected (as he told me himself)
the phraseology of both Mr. Hume and Dr. Robertson' (<i>ante</i>, v. 92,
n. 3). He is not unlikely, in Robertson's case, to have sought and
obtained Johnson's help.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p><i>The following letter is published in Mr. Alfred Morrison's 'Collection
of Autographs', vol. ii. p. 343.</i></p>

<p>'To Dr. TAYLOR. Dated London, April 20, 1778.'</p>

<p>'The quantity of blood taken from you appears to me not sufficient.
Thrale was almost lost by the scrupulosity of his physicians, who never
bled him copiously till they bled him in despair; he then bled till he
fainted, and the stricture or obstruction immediately gave way and from
that instant he grew better.</p>

<p>'I can now give you no advice but to keep yourself totally quiet and
amused with some gentle exercise of the mind. If a suspected letter
comes, throw it aside till your health is reestablished; keep easy and
cheerful company about you, and never try to think but at those stated
and solemn times when the thoughts are summoned to the cares of futurity,
the only cares of a rational being.</p>

<p>'As to my own health I think it rather grows better; the convulsions
which left me last year at Ashbourne have never returned, and I have by
the mercy of God very comfortable nights. Let me know very often how you
are till you are quite well.'</p>

<p>This letter, though it is dated 1778, must have been written in 1780.
Thrale's first attack was in June, 1779, when he was in 'extreme danger'
(<i>ante</i>, iii. 397, n. 2, 420). Johnson had the remission of the
convulsions on June 18, 1779. He recorded on June 18, 1780:‚Äî</p>

<p>'In the morning of this day last year I perceived the remission of
those convulsions in my breast which had distressed me for more than
twenty years. I returned thanks at church for the mercy granted me,
which has now continued a year.'‚Äî<i>Prayers and Meditations</i>, p. 183.</p>

<p>Three days later he wrote to Mrs. Thrale:‚Äî</p>

<p>'It was a twelvemonth last Sunday since the convulsions in my breast
left me. I hope I was thankful when I recollected it; by removing
that disorder a great improvement was made in the enjoyment of life.'

<p>He was at Ashbourne on June 18, 1779 (<i>ante</i>, iii. 453).</p>

<p>On April 20, 1778, the very day of which this letter bears the date,
he recorded:‚Äî</p>

<p>'After a good night, as I am forced to reckon, I rose seasonably‚Ä¶.
In reviewing my time from Easter, 1777, I found a very melancholy
and shameful blank. So little has been done that days and months are
without any trace. My health has, indeed, been very much interrupted.
My nights have been commonly not only restless, but painful and fatiguing.
‚Ä¶.Some relaxation of my breast has been procured, I think, by opium,
 which, though it never gives me sleep, frees my breast from spasms.'

<p><i>Mr. Mason's 'sneering observation in his "Memoirs of Mr. William

<p>(Vol. i, p. 31.)</p>

<p>I had long failed to find a copy of these <i>Memoirs</i>, though I had
searched in the Bodleian, the British Museum, and the London Library, and
had applied to the University Library at Cambridge, and the Advocates'
Library at Edinburgh. By the kindness of Mr. R. H. Soden Smith and Mr.
R. F. Sketchley, I have obtained the following extract from a copy in
the Dyce and Forster Libraries, in the South Kensington Museum:‚Äî</p>

<p>'Conscious, notwithstanding, that to avoid writing what is <i>unnecessary</i>
is, in these days, no just plea for silence in a biographer, I have some
apology to make for having strewed these pages so thinly with the
tittle-tattle of anecdote. I am, however, too proud to make this apology
to any person but my bookseller, who will be the only real loser by the
'Those readers, who believe that I do not write immediately under
his pay, and who may have gathered from what they have already read,
that I am not so passionately enamoured of Dr. Johnson's biographical
manner, as to take that for my model, have only to throw these pages
aside, and wait till they are new-written by some one of his numerous
disciples, who may follow his master's example; and should more anecdote
than I furnish him with be wanting (as was the Doctor's case in his
life of Mr. Gray), may make amends for it by those acid eructations
of vituperative criticism, which are generated by unconcocted taste and
intellectual indigestion.'‚Äî<i>Poems by William Whitehead</i>, York, 1788

over in silence, the Memoirs close.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 36, n. 3.)</p>

<p>Mr. R. F. Sketchley kindly informs me that in the Dyce and Forster

following title:‚Äî</p>

<p>Balliol College has a copy of this work containing David Garrick's
book-plate, with Shakespeare's head at the top of it, and the following
quotation from <i>Menagiana</i> at the foot:‚Äî</p>

<p><i>Felixmarte of Hircania</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 49.)</p>

<p>'"He that follows is <i>Florismarte of Hyrcania</i>" said the barber. "What!
is Signor Florismarte there?" replied the priest; "in good faith he shall
share the same fate, notwithstanding his strange birth and chimerical
adventures; for his harsh and dry style will admit of no excuse. To the
yard with him, therefore." "With all my heart, dear Sir," answered the
housekeeper; "and with joyful alacrity she executed the command.'"
‚Äî<i>Don Quixote</i>, ed. 1820, i. 48.</p>

<p>Boswell speaks of <i>Felixmarte</i> as the old Spanish romance. In the
<i>Bibliografia dei Romanzi e Poeini Cavallereschi Italiani</i> (2nd ed.,
Milan, 1838), p. 351, it is stated that in the Spanish edition it is
called a translation from the Italian, and in the Italian edition a
translation from the Spanish. The Italian title is <i>Historia di Don
Florismante d'Ircania, tradotta dallo Spagnuolo</i>. Cervantes, in an
edition of <i>Don Quixote</i>, published in 1605, which I have looked at,
calls the book <i>Florismarte de Hircania</i> (not <i>Florismante</i>). It should
seem that he made his hero read the Italian version.</p>

better judgment let this and <i>Amadis de Gaul</i> be exempted from the
flames, and let all the rest perish without any farther inquiry." "Not
so neighbour," replied the barber, "for behold here the renowned
<i>Don Belianis</i>." The priest replied, "This with the second, third,
and fourth parts, wants a little rhubarb to purge away its excessive
choler; there should be removed too all that relates to the castle
of Fame, and other impertinencies of still greater consequence; let them
have the benefit, therefore, of transportation, and as they show signs
of amendment they shall hereafter be treated with mercy or justice; in

the numerous race of enamels; also the painted snuff-box. ‚Ä¶ He died

<p>I am, no doubt, right in identifying Olivia Lloyd, the young quaker,
with whom Johnson was much enamoured when at Stourbridge School, with
Olive Lloyd, the daughter of the first Sampson Lloyd, of Birmingham,
and aunt of the Sampson Lloyd with whom he had an altercation (<i>ante</i>,
ii. 458 and <i>post</i>, p. liii). 'A fine likeness of her is preserved by
Thomas Lloyd, The Priory, Warwick,' as I learn from an interesting
little work called <i>Farm and its Inhabitants, with some Account of

<p><i>Mrs. Williams's account of Mrs. Johnson and her sons by her former
marriage</i>. (Vol. i, p. 95.)</p>

<p>The following note by Malone I failed to quote in the right place. It
is copied from a paper, written by Lady Knight.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Williams's account of Mrs. Johnson was, that she had a good
understanding and great sensibility, but inclined to be satirical. Her
first husband died insolvent [this is a mistake, see <i>ante</i>, i. 95,
n. 3]; her sons were much disgusted with her for her second marriage;
‚Ä¶ however, she always retained her affection for them. While they
[Mr. and Mrs. Johnson] resided in Gough Square, her son, the officer,
knocked at the door, and asked the maid if her mistress was at home.
She answered, "Yes, Sir, but she is sick in bed." "Oh," says he, "if
it's so, tell her that her son Jervis called to know how she did;" and
was going away. The maid begged she might run up to tell her mistress,
and, without attending his answer, left him. Mrs. Johnson, enraptured
to hear her son was below, desired the maid to tell him she longed to
embrace him. When the maid descended the gentleman was gone, and poor
Mrs. Johnson was much agitated by the adventure; it was the only time
he ever made an effort to see her. Dr. [Mr.] Johnson did all he could
to console his wife, but told Mrs. Williams: "Her son is uniformly
undutiful; so I conclude, like many other sober men, he might once in
his life be drunk, and in that fit nature got the better of his pride."'</p>

<p><i>Johnson's application for the mastership of the Grammar School at
Solihull in Warwickshire</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 96.)</p>

<p>Johnson, a few weeks after his marriage, applied for the mastership of<br/>

Solihull Grammar School, as is shown by the following letter, preserved<br/>

in the Pembroke College MSS., addressed to Mr. Walmsley, and quoted by<br/>

Mr. Croker. I failed to insert it in my notes.<br/>
</p>

<p><i>'Solihull, the 30 August 1735.</i></p>

<h5>'SIR,</h5>

<p>'I was favoured with yours of the 13th inst. in due time, but deferred
answering it til now, it takeing up some time to informe the Foeofees
of the contents thereof; and before they would return an Answer, desired
some time to make enquiry of the caracter of Mr. Johnson, who all agree
that he is an excellent scholar, and upon that account deserves much
better than to be schoolmaster of Solihull. But then he has the caracter
of being a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of
distorting his Face (which though he can't help) the gent, think it
may affect some young ladds; for these two reasons he is not approved
on, the late master Mr. Crompton's huffing the Foeofees being stil in
their memory. However, we are all exstreamly obliged to you for thinking
of us, and for proposeing so good a schollar, but more especially is,
dear sir,</p>

<p>'Your very humble servant,</p>

<h5>'HENRY GRESWOLD.'</h5>

<p><i>Johnson's knowledge of Italian</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 115.)</p>

<p>Boswell says that he does not know 'at what time, or by what means
Johnson had acquired a competent knowledge of Italian.' In my note
on this I say 'he had read Petrarch "when but a boy."' As Petrarch
wrote chiefly in Latin, it is quite possible that Johnson did not
acquire his knowledge of Italian so early as I had thought.</p>

<p><i>Johnson's deference for the general opinion</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 200.)</p>

<p>Miss Burney records an interesting piece of criticism by Johnson. 'There
are,' he said, 'three distinct kinds of judges upon all new authors or
productions; the first are those who know no rules, but pronounce
entirely from their natural taste and feelings; the second are those who
know and judge by rules; and the third are those who know, but are above
the rules. These last are those you should wish to satisfy. Next to them
rate the natural judges; but ever despise those opinions that are formed
by the rules.'‚Äî<i>Mine. D'Arblay's Diary</i>, i. 180. Later on she writes:
‚Äî'The natural feelings of untaught hearers ought never to be slighted;
and Dr. Johnson has told me the same a thousand times;' ib. ii. 128.</p>

<p><i>Johnson in the Green Room</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. i, p. 201.)</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Herne Shepherd, in <i>Watford's Antiquarian</i> for January,
1887, p. 34, asserts that the actual words which Johnson used when
he told Garrick that he would no longer frequent his Green Room were
indecent; so indecent that Mr. Shepherd can only venture to satisfy
those whom he calls students by informing them of them privately. For
proof of this charge against the man whose boast it was that 'obscenity
had always been repressed in his company' (<i>ante</i>, iv. 295) he brings
forward John Wilkes. The story, indeed, as it is told by Boswell, is
not too trustworthy, for he had it through Hume from Garrick. As it
reaches Mr. Shepherd it comes from Garrick through Wilkes. Garrick, no
doubt, as Johnson says (<i>ante</i>, v. 391), was, as a companion, 'restrained
by some principle,' and had 'some delicacy of feeling.' Nevertheless,
in his stories, he was, we may be sure, no more on oath than a man is
in lapidary inscriptions (<i>ante</i>, ii. 407). It is possible that he
reported  Johnson's very words to Hume, and that Hume did not change
them in reporting them to Boswell. Whatever they were, they were spoken
in 1749 and published in 1791, when Johnson had been dead six years,
Garrick twelve years, and Hume fourteen years. It is idle to dream that
they can now be conjecturally  emended. But it is worse than idle to
bring in as evidence John Wilkes. What entered his ear as purity itself
might issue from his mouth as the grossest obscenity. He had no delicacy
of feeling. No principle restrained him. When he comes to bear testimony,
and aims a shaft at any man's character, the bow that he draws is drawn
with the weakness of the hand of a worn-out and shameless profligate.</p>

<p>Mr. Shepherd quotes an unpublished letter of Boswell to Wilkes, dated
Rome, April 22, 1765, to show 'that the two men had become familiars,
not only long before Wilkes's famous meeting with Dr. Johnson was brought
about, but before even the friendship of Boswell himself with Johnson
had been consolidated.' It needs no unpublished letters to show that. It
must be known to every attentive reader of Boswell. See <i>ante</i>, i. 395,
and ii. 11.</p>

<p>'Berlin, 28 August, 1764.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ 'I have had another letter from my father, in which he continues of
opinion that travelling is of very little use, and may do a great deal
of harm. ‚Ä¶ I esteem and love my father, and I am determined to do what
is in my power to make him easy and happy. But you will allow that I
may endeavour to make him happy, and at the same time not to be too hard
upon myself. I must use you so much with the freedom of a friend as to
tell you that with the vivacity which you allowed me I have a melancholy
disposition. I have made excursions into the fields of amusement, perhaps
of folly. I have found that amusement and folly are beneath me, and that
without some laudable pursuit my life must be insipid and wearisome‚Ä¶..
My father seems much against my going to Italy, but gives me leave to go
from this, and pass some months in Paris. I own that the words of the
Apostle Paul, "I must see Rome," are strongly <i>borne in</i> upon my mind. It
would give me infinite pleasure. It would give taste for a life-time,
and I should go home to Auchinleck with serene contentment.'</p>

<p>After stating that he is going to Geneva, he continues:‚Äî</p>

<p>'In France, to which my ideas [in the <i>Essay on the Study of Literature</i>]
were confined, the learning and language of Greece and Rome were
neglected by a philosophic age. The guardian of those studies, the
Academy of Inscriptions, was degraded to the lowest rank among the
three royal societies of Paris; the new appellation of <i>Erudits</i> was
contemptuously applied to the successors of Lipsius and Casaubon; and
I was provoked to hear (see M. d'Alembert, <i>Discours pr√©liminaire √†
l'Encyclopedie</i>) that the exercise of the memory, their sole merit,
had been superseded by the nobler faculties of the imagination and the
judgment.'

<p><i>A Synod of Cooks</i>.</p>

of Milton's 'Synod of Gods,' in Beelzebub's speech in Paradise Lost,
book ii. line 391.</p>

<p><i>Johnson and Bishop Percy</i>.</p>

Oxford, 1885.</p>

<p>'The <i>Advertisement to Religion and Policy, by Edward Earl of Clarendon</i>,
runs as follows:‚Äî</p>

<p>"Henry Viscount Cornbury, who was called up to the House of Peers
by the title of Lord Hyde, in the lifetime of his father, Henry Earl
of Rochester, by a codicil to his will, dated Aug. 10, 1751, left
divers MSS. of his great grandfather, Edward Earl of Clarendon, to
Trustees, with a direction that the money to arise from the sale or
publication thereof, should be employed as a beginning of a fund for
supporting a Manage or Academy for riding and other useful exercises
in Oxford; a plan of this sort having been also recommended by Lord
Clarendon in his Dialogue  on Education. Lord Cornbury dying before
his father, this bequest did not take effect. But Catharine, one of
the daughters of Henry Earl of Rochester, and late Duchess Dowager
of Queensbury, whose property these MSS. became, afterwards by deed
gave them, together with all the monies which had arisen or might arise
from the sale or publication of them, to [three Trustees] upon trust
for the like purposes as those expressed by Lord Hyde in his codicil."</p>

<p>'The preface to the <i>Life of Edward Earl of Clarendon, written by
himself</i>., has words to the same effect. (See also <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
Ser. I. x. 185, and xi. 32.)</p>

<p>'From a letter in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, Ser. II. x. p. 74, it appears
that in 1860 the available sum, in the hands of the Trustees of the
Clarendon Bequest, amounted to ¬£10,000. The University no longer needed
a riding-school, and the claims of Physical Science were urgent; and in
1872 the announcement was made, that by the liberality of the Clarendon
Trustees an additional wing had been added to the University Museum,
containing the lecture-rooms and laboratories of the department of
Experimental Philosophy.' Vol. i. p. 305.</p>

<p>Christopher Smart.</p>

<p>(Vol. ii, p. 454, n. 3.)</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Browning, in his Parleyings with Christopher Smart, under
the similitude of 'some huge house,' thus describes the general run of
that unfortunate poet's verse:‚Äî</p>

<p>¬†¬†'All showed the Golden Mean without a hint<br/>

¬†¬†Of brave extravagance that breaks the rule.<br/>

¬†¬†The master of the mansion was no fool<br/>

¬†¬†Assuredly, no genius just as sure!<br/>

¬†¬†Safe mediocrity had scorned the lure<br/>

¬†¬†Of now too much and now too little cost,<br/>

¬†¬†And satisfied me sight was never lost<br/>

¬†¬†Of moderate design's accomplishment<br/>

¬†¬†In calm completeness.'<br/>
</p>

<p>Mr. Browning goes on to liken one solitary poem to a Chapel in the house,
in which is found‚Äî</p>

<p>¬†¬†'from floor to roof one evidence<br/>

¬†¬†Of how far earth may rival heaven.'<br/>

<p><i>Johnsons discussion on baptism‚Äîwith Mr. Lloyd, the Birmingham Quaker</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. ii, p. 458.)</p>

<p>In <i>Farm and its Inhabitants</i> (<i>ante</i>, p. xlii), a further account is
given of the controversy between Johnson and Mr. Lloyd the Quaker, on
the subject of Barclay's <i>Apology</i>.</p>

<p>'Tradition states that, losing his temper, Dr. Johnson threw the volume<br/>

on the floor, and put his foot on it, in denunciation of its statements.<br/>

The identical volume is now in the possession of G. B. Lloyd, of Edgbaston<br/>

Grove.<br/>
</p>

<p>'At the dinner table he continued the debate in such angry tones, and
struck the table so violently that the children were frightened, and
desired to escape.</p>

<p>'The next morning Dr. Johnson went to the bank [Mr. Lloyd was a banker]
and by way of apology called out in his stentorian voice, "I say, Lloyd,
I'm the best theologian, but you are the best Christian.'" p. 41. It
could not have been 'the next morning' that Johnson went to the bank,
for he left for Lichfield on the evening of the day of the controversy
(<i>ante</i>, ii. 461). He must have gone in the afternoon, while Boswell
was away seeing Mr. Boulton's great works at Soho (ib. p. 459).</p>

<p>Mr. G. B. Lloyd, the great-grandson of Johnson's host, in a letter
written this summer (1886), says: 'Having spent much of my boyhood
with my grandfather in the old house, I have heard him tell the story
of the stamping on the broad volume.'</p>

<p>Boswell mentions (ib. p. 457) that 'Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, like their
Majesties, had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children,
their numbers being exactly the same.' The author of <i>Farm and its
Inhabitants</i> says (p. 46): 'There is a tradition that when Sampson
Lloyd's wife used to feel depressed by the care of such a large family
(they had sixteen children) he would say to her, "Never mind, the
twentieth will be the most welcome."' His fifteenth child Catharine
married Dr. George Birkbeck, the founder of the Mechanics' Institutes
(ib. p. 48).</p>

<p>A story told (p. 50) of one of Mr. Lloyd's sons-in-law, Joseph Biddle,
is an instance of that excess of forgetfulness which Johnson called
'morbid oblivion' (<i>ante</i>, v. 68). 'He went to pay a call in Leamington.
The servant asked him for his name, he could not remember it; in
perplexity he went away, when a friend in the street met him and
accosted him, "How do you do, Mr. Biddle?" "Oh, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle,
that's the name," cried he, and rushed off to pay his call.'</p>

<p>The editor is in error in stating (p. 45, n. 1) that a very poor poem
entitled <i>A bone for Friend Mary to pick</i>, is by Johnson. It may be
found in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i> for 1791, p. 948.</p>

<p><i>Lichfield in 1783.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. ii, p. 461.)</p>

<p>C. P. Moritz, a young Prussian clergyman who published an account of
a pedestrian tour that he made in England in the year 1782, thus describes
Lichfield as he saw it on a day in June:‚Äî</p>

<p>'At noon I got to Lichfield, an old-fashioned town with narrow dirty
streets, where for the first time I saw round panes of glass in the
windows. The place to me wore an unfriendly appearance; I therefore
made no use of my recommendation, but went straight through and only
bought some bread at a baker's, which I took along with me.'‚Äî<i>Travels
in England in 1782</i>, p. 140, by C. P. Moritz. Cassell's National Library,
1886.</p>

<p>The 'recommendation' was an introduction to an inn given him by the
daughter of his landlord at Sutton, who told him 'that the people in
Lichfield were, in general, very proud.' Travelling as he did, on foot
and without luggage, he was looked upon with suspicion at the inns,
and often rudely refused lodging.</p>

<p><i>Richard Baxter's doubt</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. ii, p. 477.)</p>

<p>The Rev. J. Hamilton Davies [See <i>ante</i>, p. xlix. 1] informs me that
there can be no doubt that Johnson referred to the following passage
in <i>Reliquiae Baxterianae</i>, folio edition of 1696, p. 127:‚Äî</p>

<p>'This is another thing which I am changed in; that whereas in my
younger days I was never tempted to doubt of the Truth of Scripture
or Christianity, but all my Doubts and Fears were exercised at home,
about my own Sincerity and Interest in Christ‚Äîsince then my sorest
assaults have been on the other side, and such they were, that had I
been void of internal Experience, and the adhesion of Love, and the
special help of God, and had not discerned more Reason for my Religion
than I did when I was younger, I had certainly apostatized to Infidelity,'
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Johnson, the day after he recorded his 'doubt,' wrote that he was
'troubled with Baxter's <i>scruple</i>' (<i>ante</i>, ii. 477). The 'scruple'
was, perhaps, the same as the 'doubt.' In his <i>Dictionary</i> he defines
<i>scruple</i> as <i>doubt; difficulty of determination; perplexity; generally
about minute things</i>.</p>

<p><i>Oxford in 1782</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. iii, p. 13, n. 3.)</p>

<p>The Rev. C. P. Moritz (<i>ante</i>, p. liv) gives a curious account of
his visit to Oxford. On his way from Dorchester on the evening of
a Sunday in June, he had been overtaken by the Rev. Mr. Maud, who seems
to have been a Fellow and Tutor of Corpus College[3], and who was
returning from doing duty in his curacy. It was late when they arrived
in the town. Moritz, who, as I have said, more than once had found
great difficulty in getting a bed, had made up his mind to pass the
summer night on a stonebench in the High Street. His comrade would not
hear of this, but said that he would take him to an ale-house where
'it is possible they mayn't be gone to bed, and we may yet find company.'
This ale-house was the Mitre.</p>

<p>'We went on a few houses further, and then knocked at a door. It was
then nearly twelve. They readily let us in; but how great was my
astonishment when, on being shown into a room on the left, I saw
a great number of clergymen, all with their gowns and bands on, sitting
round a large table, each with his pot of beer before him. My travelling
companion introduced me to them as a German clergyman, whom he could not
sufficiently praise for my correct pronunciation of the Latin, my
orthodoxy, and my good walking.</p>

<p>'I now saw myself in a moment, as it were, all at once transported
into the midst of a company, all apparently very respectable men, but
all strangers to me. And it appeared to me extraordinary that I should
thus at midnight be in Oxford, in a large company of Oxonian clergy,
without well knowing how I had got there. Meanwhile, however, I took
all the pains in my power to recommend myself to my company, and in the
course of conversation I gave them as good an account as I could of
our German universities, neither denying nor concealing that now and
then we had riots and disturbances. "Oh, we are very unruly here,
too," said one of the clergymen, as he took a hearty draught out of his
pot of beer, and knocked on the table with his hand. The conversation
now became louder, more general, and a little confused. ‚Ä¶ At last,
when morning drew near, Mr. Maud suddenly exclaimed, "D-n me, I must
read prayers this morning at All Souls!" "D-n me" is an abbreviation
of "G-d d-n me," which in England does not seem to mean more mischief
or harm than any of our or their common expletives in conversation,
such as "O gemini!" or "The deuce take me!" ‚Ä¶ I am almost ashamed
to own, that next morning, when I awoke, I had got so dreadful a
headache from the copious and numerous toasts of my jolly and reverend
friends that I could not possibly get up.

<p><i>William Vachell</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. iii, p. 83, n. 3.)</p>

<p>Mr. George Parker of the Bodleian Library informs me that William
Vachell had been tutor to Prince Esterhazy, and that for many years
he held the appointment of 'Pumper,' or Lessee of the baths at Bath.
In 1776 and 1777 he paid as rental for them to the Corporation ¬£525.
He died on November 26, 1789. According to Mr. Ivor Vachell (<i>Notes
and Queries</i>, 6th S. vii. 327), it was his eldest son who signed the
Round Robin.</p>

<p><i>Johnson and Baretti</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. iii, p. 96, n. 1.)</p>

<p>Baretti in his <i>Tolondron</i>, p. 145, gives an account of a difference
between himself and Johnson. Johnson sent to ask him to call on him,
but Baretti was leaving town. When he returned the time for a
reconciliation had passed, for Johnson was dead.</p>

<p><i>English pulpit eloquence</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. iii, p. 248.)</p>

<p>'Upon the whole, which is preferable, the philosophic method of the
English, or the rhetoric of the French preachers? The first (though
less glorious) is certainly safer for the preacher. It is difficult
for a man to make himself ridiculous, who proposes only to deliver
plain sense on a subject he has thoroughly studied. But the instant
he discovers the least pretensions towards the sublime or the pathetic,
there is no medium; we must either admire or laugh; and there are so
many various talents requisite to form the character of an orator that
it is more than probable we shall laugh.'

<p>The Rev. John Rigaud, B.D., Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, has
kindly sent me the following anecdote of the meeting of Johnson and
Parr:‚Äî</p>

<p>'I remember Dr. Routh, the old President of Magdalen, telling me of an
interview and conversation between Dr. Johnson and Dr. Parr, in the
course of which the former made use of some expression respecting the
latter, which considerably wounded and offended him. "Sir," he said
to Dr. Johnson, "you know that what you have just said will be known
in four-and-twenty hours over this vast metropolis." Upon which Dr.
Johnson's manner altered, his eye became calm, and he put out his hand,
and said, "Forgive me, Parr, I didn't quite mean it." "But," said the
President, with an amused and amusing look, "<i>I never could get him to
tell me what it was Dr. Johnson had said!</i>" He spoke of seeing Dr.
Johnson going up the steps into University College, dressed, I think,
in a snuff-coloured coat.'</p>

<p>Dr. Martin Joseph Routh, who was President of Magdalen College for
sixty-four years, was born in 1755 and died on December 22, 1854.</p>

in illustration of Johnson's statement:‚Äî</p>

<p>'And yet I did usually put in something in my Sermon which was above
their own discovery, and which they had not known before; and this I
did, that they might be kept humble, and still perceive their ignorance,
and be willing to keep in a learning state. (For when Preachers tell
their People of no more than they know, and do not shew that they excel
them in knowledge, and easily overtop them in Abilities, the People
will be tempted to turn Preachers themselves, and think that they have
learnt all that the Ministers can teach them, and are as wise as
they‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî). And this I did also to increase their knowledge; and
also to make Religion pleasant to them, by a daily addition to their
former Sight, and to draw them on with desire and Delight.'</p>

<p>'The commonest cause [of suicide] is melancholy, &amp;c. Though there

<p>'Once all the ignorant Rout were raging mad against me for preaching
the Doctrine of Original Sin to them, and telling them that Infants
before Regeneration had so much Guilt and Corruption, as made them
loathsome in the Eyes of God: whereupon they vented it abroad in the

they railed at me as I passed through the streets. The next Lord's Day,
I cleared and confirmed it, and shewed them that if this were not true,
their Infants had no need of Christ, of Baptism, or of Renewing by the
Holy Ghost. And I asked them whether they durst say that their Children
were saved without a Saviour, and were no Christians, and why they
baptized them, with much more to that purpose, and afterwards they

violation of the laws of hospitality as well as of other principles,

<p>Johnson, writing from Ashbourne to Dr. Brocklesby on July 20, 1784, says:
'I am now looking into Floyer who lived with his asthma to almost his
ninetieth year.' Mr. Samuel Timmins, the author of <i>Dr. Johnson in
Birmingham</i>, informs me that he and two friends of his lately found
in Lichfield a Lending Book of the Cathedral Library. Among the entries
for 1784 was: '<i>Sir John Floyer on the Asthma</i>, lent to Dr. Johnson.'
Johnson, no doubt, had taken the book with him to Ashbourne.</p>

<p>Mr. Timmins says that the entries in this Lending Book unfortunately
do not begin till about 1760 (or later). 'If,' he adds, 'the earlier
Lending Book could be found, it would form a valuable clue to books
which Johnson may have borrowed in his youth and early manhood.'</p>

<p><i>The University of St. Andrews in 1778</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 63, n. 2.)</p>

<p>In the preface to <i>Poems by George Monck Berkeley</i>, it is recorded
(p. cccxlviii) that when 'Mr. Berkeley entered at the University of
St. Andrews [about 1778], one of the college officers called upon him
to deposit a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr. Berkeley
said, that as he should reside in his father's house, it was little
likely he should break any windows, having never, that he remembered,
broke one in his life. He was assured that he <i>would</i> do it at St.
Andrews. On the rising of the session several of the students said, "Now
for the windows. Come, it is time to set off, let us sally forth!"
Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be done? They
replied, "Why, to break every window in college." "For what reason?"
"Oh! no reason; but that it has always been done from time immemorial."'
The Editor goes on to say that Mr. Berkeley prevailed on them to give
up the practice. How poor some of the students were is shown by the
following anecdote, told by the College Porter, who had to collect the
crowns. 'I am just come,' he said, 'from a poor student indeed. I went
for the window <i>croon</i>; he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it,
saying, "he brought but a croon to keep him all the session, and he
had spent sixpence of it; so I have got only four and sixpence."' His
father, a labourer, who owned three cows, 'had sold one to dress his
son for the University, and put the lamented croon in his pocket to
purchase coals. All the lower students study by fire-light. He had
brought with him a large tub of oatmeal and a pot of salted butter, on
which he was to subsist from Oct. 20 until May 20.' Berkeley raised
'a very noble subscription' for the poor fellow.</p>

<p>In another passage (p. cxcviii) it is recorded that Berkeley 'boasted to
his father, "Well, Sir, idle as you may think me, I never have once
bowed at any Professor's Lecture." An explanation being requested of
the word <i>bowing</i>, it was thus given: "Why, if any poor fellow has
been a little idle, and is not prepared to speak when called upon by
the Professor, he gets up and makes a respectful-bow, and sits down
again."' Berkeley was a grandson of Bishop Berkeley.</p>

<p><i>Johnson's unpublished sermons</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 67, n. i.)</p>

<p>'JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ., TO JAMES ABERCROMBIE, ESQ., of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>'June 11, 1792.</p>

<p>"I have not yet been able to discover any more of Johnson's sermons
besides those left for publication by Dr. Taylor. I am informed by the
Lord Bishop of Salisbury, that he gave an excellent one to a clergyman,
who preached and published it in his own name on some public occasion.
But the Bishop has not as yet told me the name, and seems unwilling to
do it. Yet I flatter myself I shall get at it."'
‚ÄîNichols's <i>Literary History</i>, vii. 315.</p>

<p><i>Tillotson's argument against the doctrine of transubstantiation.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 71.)</p>

<p>Gibbon, writing of his reconversion from Roman Catholicism to
Protestantism in the year 1754, after allowing something to the
conversation of his Swiss tutor, says:‚Äî</p>

<p>'I must observe that it was principally effected by my private
reflections; and I  still remember my solitary transport at the discovery
of a philosophical argument against the doctrine of transubstantiation‚Äî
<i>that</i> the text of scripture which seems to inculcate the real presence
is attested only by a single sense‚Äî our sight; while the real presence
itself is disproved by three of our senses‚Äîthe sight, the touch, and
the taste.'
‚Äî<i>Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</i>, ed. 1827, i. 67.</p>

<p><i>Jean Pierre de Crousaz</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 80.)</p>

<p>Gibbon, describing his education at Lausanne, says:‚Äî'The principles
of philosophy were associated with the examples of taste; and by a
singular chance the book as well as the man which contributed the most
effectually to my education has a stronger claim on my gratitude than
on my admiration. M. de Crousaz, the adversary of Bayle and Pope, is not
distinguished by lively fancy or profound reflection; and even in his
own country, at the end of a few years, his name and writings are almost
obliterated. But his philosophy had been formed in the school of Locke,
his divinity in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious
life several generations of pupils were taught to think and even to
write; his lessons rescued the Academy of Lausanne from Calvinistic
prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit
among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud.'

<p><i>The new pavement in London.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 84, n. 3.)</p>

<p>'By an Act passed in 1766, <i>For the better cleansing, paving, and
enlightning the City of London and Liberties thereof</i>, &amp;c., powers
are granted in pursuance of which the great streets have been paved
with whyn-quarry stone, or rock-stone, or stone of a flat surface.'
‚Äî<i>A Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain</i>, ed. 1769,
vol. ii, p. 121.</p>

<p><i>Boswell's Projected Works.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 91, n. 2.)</p>

<p>To this list should be added an account of a Tour to the Isle of Man
(<i>ante</i>, iii. 80).</p>

<p><i>A cancel in the first edition of Boswell's 'Journal of a Tour to the
Hebrides</i>.'</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 151.)</p>

<p>In my note on the suppression of offensive passages in the second edition
of Boswell's <i>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</i> (<i>ante</i>, v. 148), I
mention that Rowlandson in one of his  <i>Caricatures</i> paints Boswell
begging Sir Alexander Macdonald for mercy, while on the ground lie
pages 165, 167, torn out. I have discovered, though too late to mention
in the proper place, that in the first edition the leaf containing pages
167, 168, was really cancelled. In my own copy I noticed between pages 168
and 169 a narrow projecting slip of paper. I found the same in the copy
in the British Museum. Mr. Horace Hart, the printer to the University,
who has kindly examined my copy, informs me that the leaf was cancelled
after the sheets had been stitched together. It was cut out, but an edge
was left to which the new one was attached by paste. The leaf thus
treated begins with the words 'talked with very high respect' (<i>ante</i>,
v. 149) and ends 'This day was little better than a blank' (<i>ante</i>,
v. 151). This conclusion was perhaps meant to be significant to the
observant reader.</p>

<p><i>Boswell's conversation with the King about the title proper to be
given to the Young Pretender.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 185, n. 4.)</p>

<p>Dr. Lort wrote to Bishop Percy on Aug. 15, 1785:‚Äî</p>

<p>'Boswell's book [<i>The Tour to the Hebrides</i>], I suppose, will be out
in the winter. The King at his lev√©e talked to him, as was natural, on
this subject. Boswell told his majesty that he had another work on the
anvil‚Äîa <i>History of the Rebellion in</i> 1745 (<i>ante</i>, iii. 162); but
that he was at a loss how to style the  principal person who figured
in it. "How would you style him, Mr. Boswell?" "I was thinking, Sire,
of calling him the grandson of the unfortunate James the Second." "That
I have no objection  to; my title to the Crown stands on firmer ground
‚Äîon an Act of Parliament." This is said to be the <i>substance</i> of a
conversation which passed at the lev√©e. I wish I was certain of the
exact words.'
‚ÄîNichols's <i>Literary History</i>, vii. 472.</p>

<p><i>Shakespeare's popularity</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 244, n. 2.)</p>

<p>Gibbon, after describing how he used to attend Voltaire's private theatre
at Monrepos in 1757 and 1758, continues:‚Äî</p>

<p>'The habits of pleasure fortified my taste for the French theatre, and
that taste has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of
Shakespeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the first duty of
an Englishman.'
‚Äî<i>Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</i>, ed. 1837, i. 90.</p>

<p><i>Archibald Campbell</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 357.)</p>

<p>Mr. C. E. Doble informs me that in the Bodleian Library 'there is a
characteristic letter of Archibald Campbell in a <i>Life of Francis
Lee</i> in Rawlinson, J., 4to. 2. 197; and also a skeleton life of him
in Rawlinson, J., 4to. 5. 301.'</p>

<p><i>Cocoa Tree Club.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 386, n. 1.)</p>

<p>Gibbon records in his Journal on November 24, 1762, a visit to the Cocoa<br/>

Tree Club:‚Äî<br/>
</p>

<p>'That respectable body, of which I have the honour of being a member,
affords every evening a sight truly English. Twenty or thirty, perhaps,
of the first men in the kingdom in point of fashion and fortune, supping
at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room,
upon a bit of cold meat or a sandwich, and drinking a glass of punch.
At present we are full of king's counsellors and lords of the bed-chamber,
who, having jumped into the ministry, make a very singular medley
of their old principles and language with their modern ones.'
‚Äî<i>Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</i>, ed. 1827, i. 131.</p>

<p><i>Johnson's use of the word 'big'</i>.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 425.)</p>

<p>On volume i, page 471, Johnson says: 'Don't, Sir, accustom yourself to
use big words for little matters.'</p>

<p><i>Atlas, the Duke of Devonshire's race-horse.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 429.)</p>

<p>Johnson, in his <i>Diary of a Journey into North Wales</i>, records on<br/>

July 12, 1774:‚Äî<br/>
</p>

<p>'At Chatsworth‚Ä¶, Atlas, fifteen hands inch and half.'</p>

<p>Mr. Duppa in a note on this, says: 'A race-horse, which attracted so
much of Dr. Johnson's attention, that he said, "of all the Duke's
possessions I like Atlas best."'</p>

<p>Thomas Holcroft, who in childhood wandered far and wide with his father,
a pedlar, was at Nottingham during the race-week  of the year 1756 or
1757, and saw in its youth the horse which Johnson so much admired in
its old age. He says: 'The great and glorious part which Nottingham held
in the annals of racing this year, arose from the prize of the King's
plate, which was to be contended for by the two horses which everybody
I heard speak considered as undoubtedly the best in England, and perhaps
 equal to any that had ever been known, Childers alone excepted. Their
names were Careless and Atlas‚Ä¶..There was a story in circulation that
Atlas, on account of his size and clumsiness, had been banished to the
cart-breed; till by some accident, either of playfulness or fright,
several of them started together; and his vast advantage in speed
happening to be noticed, he was restored to his blood companions‚Ä¶..Alas
for the men of Nottingham, Careless was conquered. I forget whether it
was at two or three heats, but there was many an empty purse on that
night, and many a sorrowful heart.'
‚Äî<i>Memoirs of Thomas Holcroft</i>, i. 70.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Clough.</p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 436.)</p>

<p>There is an interesting note on Sir Richard Clough, the founder of B√¢ch
y Graig, in Professor Rhys's edition of Pennant's <i>Tours in Wales</i>
(vol. ii, p. 137). The Professor writes to me:‚Äî</p>

<p>'Sir Richard Clough's wealth was so great that it became a saying of the
people in North Wales that a man who grew very wealthy was or had become
a Clough. This has long been forgotten; but it is still said in Welsh,
in North Wales, that a very rich man is a regular <i>clwch</i>, which is
pronounced with the guttural spirant, which was then (in the 16th
century) sounded in English, just as the English word <i>draught</i> (of
drink) is in Welsh <i>dracht</i> pronounced nearly as if it were German.'</p>

<p><i>Evan Evans.</i></p>

<p>(Vol. v, p. 443.)</p>

<p>Evan Evans, who is described as being 'incorrigibly addicted to strong
drink,' was Curate of Llanvair Talyhaern, in Denbighshire, and author
of <i>Some Specimens of the Poetry of Antient Welsh Bards translated into
English</i>. London, R. &amp; J. Dodsley, 1764. My friend Mr. Morfill informs
me that he remembers to have seen it stated in a manuscript note in a
book in the Bodleian, that 'Evan Evans would have written much more if
he had not been so much given up to the bottle.'</p>

<p>Gray thus mentions Evan Evans in a letter to Dr. Wharton, written in<br/>

July, 1760:‚Äî<br/>
</p>

<p>'The Welsh Poets are also coming to light. I have seen a discourse in
MS. about them (by one Mr. Evans, a clergyman) with specimens of their
writings. This is in Latin; and though it don't approach the other
[Macpherson], there are fine scraps among it.'

<h5>1.F.</h5>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<h4>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h5>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h5>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

<p>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p>https://www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>

<p>EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.</p>

<p>http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06<br/>
</p>

<p>¬†¬†¬†¬†(Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,<br/>

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)<br/>
</p>

<p>EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:</p>

<p>https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234</p>

<p>or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689</p>
