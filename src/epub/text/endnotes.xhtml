					<p>Six years before this Dedication Sir Joshua had conferred on him another favour. “I have a proposal to make to you,” Boswell had written to him, “I am for certain to be called to the English bar next February. Will you now do my picture? and the price shall be paid out of the first fees which I receive as a barrister in Westminster Hall. Or if that fund should fail, it shall be paid at any rate five years hence by myself or my representatives.” Boswell told him at the same time that the debts which he had contracted in his father’s lifetime would not be cleared off for some years. The letter was endorsed by Sir Joshua:⁠—“I agree to the above conditions;” and the portrait was painted. <cite>—Taylor’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 477</cite>. <a href="dedication-2.xhtml#noteref-53" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Boswell writing to Temple in 1775, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“I try to keep a journal, and shall show you that I have done tolerably; but it is hardly credible what ground I go over, and what a variety of men and manners I contemplate in a day; and all the time I myself am <i xml:lang="la">pars magna</i>, for my exuberant spirits will not let me listen enough.”</p>

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barclay said that “he had seen Boswell lay down his knife and fork, and take out his tablets, in order to register a good anecdote.” Croker’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Boswell</i>, page 837. The account given by Paoli to Miss Burney, shows that very early in life Boswell took out his tablets:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“He came to my country, and he fetched me some letter of recommending him; but I was of the belief he might be an impostor, and I supposed in my minde he was an espy; for I look away from him, and in a moment I look to him again, and I behold his tablets. Oh! he was to the work of writing down all I say. Indeed I was angry. But soon I discover he was no impostor and no espy; and I only find I was myself the monster he had come to discern. Oh! he is a very good man; I love him indeed; so cheerful, so gay, so pleasant! but at the first, oh! I was indeed angry.”</p>

					</blockquote>
					<p>Boswell not only recorded the conversations, he often stimulated them. On one occasion “he assumed,” he said, “an air of ignorance to incite <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson to talk, for which it was often necessary to employ some address.” See <i>post</i>, April 12, 1776. “Tom Tyers,” said Johnson, “described me the best. He once said to me, ‘Sir, you are like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.’ ” <cite>—Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 20, 1773</cite>. Boswell writing of this Tour said:⁠—“I also may be allowed to claim some merit in leading the conversation; I do not mean leading, as in an orchestra, by playing the first fiddle; but leading as one does in examining a witness⁠—starting topics, and making him pursue them.” <i>Ib.</i> <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 28. One day he recorded:⁠—“I did not exert myself to get <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson to talk, that I might not have the labour of writing down his conversation.” <i>Ib.</i> <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 7. His industry grew much less towards the close of Johnson’s life. Under <time datetime="1781-05-08">May 8, 1781</time>, he records:⁠—“Of his conversation on that and other occasions during this period, I neglected to keep any regular record.” On <time datetime="1783-05-15">May 15, 1783</time>:⁠—“I have no minute of any interview with Johnson [from May 1] till May 15. “<time datetime="1784-05-15">May 15, 1784</time>:⁠—“Of these days and others on which I saw him I have no memorials.” <a href="foreword-1.xhtml#noteref-61" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>It is an interesting question how far Boswell derived his love of truth from himself, and how far from Johnson’s training. He was one of Johnson’s <em>school</em>. He himself quotes Reynolds’s observation, “that all who were of his <em>school</em> are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy, which they would not have possessed in the same degree if they had not been acquainted with Johnson” (<i>post</i>, under <time datetime="1778-03-30">March 30, 1778</time>).

					<blockquote>
						<p>“And who will be my biographer,” said he, “do you think?” “Goldsmith, no doubt,” replied I; “and he will do it the best among us.” “The dog would write it best to be sure,” replied he; “but his particular malice towards me, and general disregard for truth, would make the book useless to all, and injurious to my character.” “Oh! as to that,” said I, “we should all fasten upon him, and force him to do you justice; but the worst is, the Doctor does not <em>know</em> your life; nor can I tell indeed who does, except <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Taylor of Ashbourne.” “Why Taylor,” said he, “is better acquainted with my <em>heart</em> than any man or woman now alive; and the history of my Oxford exploits lies all between him and Adams; but <abbr>Dr.</abbr> James knows my very early days better than he. After my coming to London to drive the world about a little, you must all go to Jack Hawkesworth for anecdotes: I lived in great familiarity with him (though I think there was not much affection) from the year 1753 till the time <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale and you took me up. I intend, however, to disappoint the rogues, and either make you write the life, with Taylor’s intelligence; or, which is better, do it myself after outliving you all. I am now,” added he, “keeping a diary, in hopes of using it for that purpose sometime.”</p>

					<p>How much of this is true cannot be known. Boswell some time before this conversation had told Johnson that he intended to write his Life, and Johnson had given him many particulars (see <i>post</i>, <time datetime="1772-03-31">March 31, 1772</time>, and <time datetime="1773-04-11">April 11, 1773</time>).

					<p>The greatest part of this book was written while Sir John Hawkins was alive; and I avow, that one object of my strictures was to make him feel some compunction for his illiberal treatment of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson. Since his decease, I have suppressed several of my remarks upon his work. But though I would not “war with the dead” <em>offensively</em>, I think it necessary to be strenuous in <em>defence</em> of my illustrious friend, which I cannot be without strong animadversions upon a writer who has greatly injured him. Let me add, that though I doubt I should not have been very prompt to gratify Sir John Hawkins with any compliment in his lifetime, I do now frankly acknowledge, that, in my opinion, his volume, however inadequate and improper as a life of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, and however discredited by unpardonable inaccuracies in other respects, contains a collection of curious anecdotes and observations, which few men but its author could have brought together. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-89" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker disbelieves the story altogether.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Sacheverel,” he says, “by his sentence pronounced in <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 1710, was interdicted for three years from preaching; so that he could not have preached at Lichfield while Johnson was under three years of age. Sacheverel, indeed, made a triumphal progress through the midland counties in 1710; and it appears by the books of the corporation of Lichfield that he was received in that town, and complimented by the attendance of the corporation, ‘and a present of three dozen of wine,’ on <time datetime="1710-06-16">June 16, 1710</time>; but then ‘the <em>infant Hercules of Toryism</em>’ was just <em>nine months</em> old.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It is quite possible that the story is in the main correct. Sacheverel was received in Lichfield in 1710 on his way down to Shropshire to take possession of a living. At the end of the suspension in March 1713 he preached a sermon in London, for which, as he told Swift, “a bookseller gave him £100, intending to print 30,000.” (<cite>—Swift’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal to Stella</i>, April 2, 1713</cite>). It is likely enough that either on his way up to town or on his return journey he preached at Lichfield. In the spring of 1713 Johnson was three years old. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-126" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This anecdote of the duck, though disproved by internal and external evidence, has nevertheless, upon supposition of its truth, been made the foundation of the following ingenious and fanciful reflections of Miss <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Seward</b>, amongst the communications concerning <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson with which she has been pleased to favour me:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“These infant numbers contain the seeds of those propensities which through his life so strongly marked his character, of that poetic talent which afterwards bore such rich and plentiful fruits; for, excepting his orthographic works, everything which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson wrote was Poetry, whose essence consists not in numbers, or in jingle, but in the strength and glow of a fancy, to which all the stores of nature and of art stand in prompt administration; and in an eloquence which conveys their blended illustrations in a language ‘more tuneable than needs or rhyme or verse to add more harmony.’</p>
						<p>“The above little verses also show that superstitious bias which ‘grew with his growth, and strengthened with his strength,’ and, of late years particularly, injured his happiness, by presenting to him the gloomy side of religion, rather than that bright and cheering one which gilds the period of closing life with the light of pious hope.”</p>

He proposed to do much of what has been since done under the direction of the Master of the Rolls. He asked for subscriptions to carry on his great undertaking, for in its researches it was to be very great. In 1744 the City of London resolved to subscribe £50 for seven years (<cite>—<abbr>ib.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>: 393</cite>). In volume <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> of his history, which only came down to the reign of John (published in 1748), he went out of his way to assert that the cure by the king’s touch was not due to the “regal <i>unction</i>”; for he had known a man cured who had gone over to France, and had been there “touched by the eldest lineal descendant of a race of kings who had not at that time been crowned or <em>anointed</em>.” (<cite>—<abbr>ib.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span> 13.</cite>) Thereupon the Court of Common Council by a unanimous vote withdrew its subscription, (<cite>—<abbr>ib.</abbr> 185</cite>.)

					<p>Johnson said of Hunter:⁠—“Abating his brutality, he was a very good master;” <i>post</i>, <time datetime="1772-03-21">March 21, 1772</time>.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The boasted liberty we talk of,” he writes, “is but a mean reward for the long servitude, the many heartaches and terrors to which our childhood is exposed in going through a grammar school.⁠ ⁠… No one who has gone through what they call a great school but must remember to have seen children of excellent and ingenuous natures (as has afterwards appeared in their manhood); I say no man has passed through this way of education but must have seen an ingenuous creature expiring with shame, with pale looks, beseeching sorrow and silent tears, throw up its honest eyes and kneel on its tender knees to an inexorable blockhead to be forgiven the false quantity of a word in making a Latin verse.”</p>

					<p>Likely enough Johnson’s roughness was in part due to this brutal treatment; for Steele goes on to say:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“It is wholly to this dreadful practise that we may attribute a certain hardiness and ferocity which some men, though liberally educated, carry about them in all their behaviour.

According to Garrick’s biographer, Tom Davies (<cite>—page 3</cite>), “Hunter was an odd mixture of the pedant and the sportsman.

						<p>“In Scotland,” he writes, “the students all come to their several colleges in November, and return home in May. So they <em>may</em> study five months in the year, and lounge all the rest!

					<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi has given a strange fantastical account of the original of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s belief in our most holy religion.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“At the age of ten years his mind was disturbed by scruples of infidelity, which preyed upon his spirits, and made him very uneasy, the more so, as he revealed his uneasiness to none, being naturally (as he said) of a sullen temper, and reserved disposition. He searched, however, diligently, but fruitlessly, for evidences of the truth of revelation; and, at length, <em>recollecting</em> a book he had once seen [I suppose at five years old] in his father’s shop, intitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">De veritate Religionis</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, he began to think himself <em>highly culpable</em> for neglecting such a means of information, and took himself severely to task for this sin, adding many acts of voluntary, and, to others, unknown <em>penance</em>. The first opportunity which offered, of course, he seized the book with avidity; but, on examination, <em>not finding himself scholar enough to peruse its contents</em>, set his heart at rest; and not thinking to enquire whether there were any English books written on the subject, followed his usual amusements and <em>considered his conscience as lightened of a crime</em>. He redoubled his diligence to learn the language that contained the information he most wished for; but from the pain which <em>guilt</em> [<em>namely having omitted to read what he did not understand</em>], had given him, he now began to deduce the soul’s immortality [<em>a sensation of pain in this world being an unquestionable proof of existence in another</em>], which was the point that belief first stopped at; <em>and from that moment resolving to be a Christian</em>, became one of the most zealous and pious ones our nation ever produced.”</p>

					</blockquote>
					<p>I have gone into this question at great length in my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson: His Friends and His Critics</i>, page 329. I am of opinion that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker’s general conclusion is right. The proof of residence is established, and alone established, by the entries in the buttery books. Now these entries show that Johnson, with the exception of the week in October 1729 ending on the 24th, was in residence till <time datetime="1729-12-12">December 12, 1729</time>. He seems to have returned for a week in March 1730, and again for a week in the following September. On three other weeks there is a charge against him of fivepence in the books. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker has made that darker which was already dark enough by confounding, as I have shown, two John Taylors who both matriculated at Christ Church. Boswell’s statement no doubt is precise, but in this he followed perhaps the account given by Hawkins. He would have been less likely to discover Hawkins’s error from the fact that, as Johnson’s name was for about three years on the College books, he was so long, in name at least, a member of the College. Had Boswell seen Johnson’s letter to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hickman, quoted by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker (Croker’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Boswell</i>, page 20), he would at once have seen that Johnson could not have remained at college for a little more than three years. For within three years all but a day of his entrance at Pembroke, he writes to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hickman from Lichfield, “<em>As I am yet unemployed</em>, I hope you will, if anything should offer, remember and recommend, Sir, your humble servant, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Sam.</abbr> Johnson.”</p>
					<p>In Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal of a tour to the Hebrides</i> (<time datetime="1773-08-15"><abbr>Aug.</abbr> 15, 1773</time>) there is a very perplexing passage bearing on Johnson’s residence at College.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“We talked of Whitefield. He said he was at the same college with him, and knew him before he began to be better than other people.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Now Johnson, as Boswell tells us, read this journal in manuscript. The statement therefore seems to be well-established indeed. Yet Whitefield did not matriculate till <time datetime="1732-11-07"><abbr>Nov.</abbr> 7, 1732</time>, a full year after Johnson, according to Boswell, had left Oxford. We are told that, when Johnson was living at Birmingham, he borrowed Lobo’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Abyssinia</i> from the library of Pembroke College. It is probable enough that a man who frequently walked from Lichfield to Birmingham and back would have trudged all the way to Oxford to fetch the book. In that case he might have seen Whitefield.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“I think it is now just forty years ago, that a young fellow had a sprig of myrtle given him by a girl he courted, and asked me to write him some verses that he might present her in return.

					<p>In my first edition I was induced to doubt the authenticity of this account, by the following circumstantial statement in a letter to me from Miss Seward, of Lichfield:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“<em>I know</em> those verses were addressed to Lucy Porter, when he was enamoured of her in his boyish days, two or three years before he had seen her mother, his future wife. He wrote them at my grandfather’s, and gave them to Lucy in the presence of my mother, to whom he showed them on the instant. She used to repeat them to me, when I asked her for <em>the Verses Dr. Johnson gave her on a Sprig of Myrtle, which he had stolen or begged from her bosom</em>. We all know honest Lucy Porter to have been incapable of the mean vanity of applying to herself a compliment not <em>intended</em> for her.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Such was this lady’s statement, which I make no doubt she supposed to be correct; but it shows how dangerous it is to trust too implicitly to traditional testimony and ingenious inference; for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hector has lately assured me that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi’s account is in this instance accurate, and that he was the person for whom Johnson wrote those verses, which have been erroneously ascribed to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hammond.</p>
					<p>I am obliged in so many instances to notice <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi’s incorrectness of relation, that I gladly seize this opportunity of acknowledging, that however often, she is not always inaccurate.</p>

					<p>One curious anecdote was communicated by himself to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Nichols. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilcox, the bookseller, on being informed by him that his intention was to get his livelihood as an author, eyed his robust frame attentively, and with a significant look, said, “You had better buy a porter’s knot.” He however added, “Wilcox was one of my best friends.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 43) states that Johnson and Garrick had soon exhausted their small stock of money in London, and that on Garrick’s suggestion they applied for a loan to Wilcox, of whom he had a slight knowledge. “Representing themselves to him, as they really were, two young men, friends and travellers from the same place, and just arrived with a view to settle here, he was so moved with their artless tale, that on their joint note he advanced them all that their modesty would permit them to ask (five pounds), which was soon after punctually repaid.” Perhaps Johnson was thinking of himself when he recorded the advice given by Cibber to Fenton, “When the tragedy of Mariamne was shown to Cibber, it was rejected by him, with the additional insolence of advising Fenton to engage himself in some employment of honest labour, by which he might obtain that support which he could never hope from his poetry. The play was acted at the other theatre; and the brutal petulance of Cibber was confuted, though perhaps not shamed, by general applause.” Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 56.

					<p>On April 17, 1778, Johnson said: “Early in life I drank wine; for many years I drank none. I then for some years drank a great deal. I then had a severe illness, and left it off, and I have never begun it again.” Somewhat the same account is given in Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 16, 1773. Roughly speaking, he seems to have been an abstainer from about 1736 to at least as late as 1757, and from about 1765 to the end of his life. In 1751 Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 286) describes him as drinking only lemonade “in a whole night spent in festivity” at the Ivy Lane Club. In 1757 he described himself “as a hardened and shameless tea-drinker, who has for twenty years diluted his meals with only tea” (Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 21). It was, I believe, in his visit to Oxford in 1759 that “University College witnessed his drinking three bottles of port without being the worse for it” (<i>post</i>, April 7, 1778). When he was living in the Temple (between 1760⁠–⁠65) he had the frisk with Langton and Beauclerk when they made a bowl of “Bishop” (<i>post</i>, 1753). On his birthday in 1760, he “resolved to drink less strong liquors’ (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i> page 42). In 1762 on his visit to Devonshire he drank three bottles of wine after supper. This was the only time Reynolds had seen him intoxicated. (Northcote’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 161). In 1763 he affected Boswell’s nerves by keeping him up late to drink port with him (<i>post</i>, July 14, 1763). On April 21, 1764, he records: “From the beginning of this year I have in some measure forborne excess of strong drink” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i> page 51). On Easter Sunday he records: “Avoided wine” (<i>ib</i>. page 55). On March 1, 1765, he is described at Cambridge as “giving <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Macaulay for his toast, and drinking her in two bumpers.” It was about this time that he had the severe illness (<i>post</i>, under <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 17, 1765, note). In <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 1766, Boswell found him no longer drinking wine. He shortly returned to it again; for on <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 2, 1767, he records, “I have for some days forborne wine;” and on <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 17, “By abstinence from wine and suppers I obtained sudden and great relief” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i> pages 73, 4). According to Hawkins, Johnson said:⁠—“After a ten years’ forbearance of every fluid except tea and sherbet, I drank one glass of wine to the health of Sir Joshua Reynolds on the evening of the day on which he was knighted” (Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson’s Works</i> (1787), <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 215). As Reynolds was knighted on April 21, 1769 (Taylor’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 321), Hawkins’s report is grossly inaccurate. In Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 16, 1773, and <i>post</i>, March 16, 1776, we find him abstaining. In 1778 he persuaded Boswell to be “a water-drinker upon trial” (<i>post</i>, April 28, 1778). On April 7, 1779, “he was persuaded to drink one glass of claret that he might judge of it, not from recollection.” On March 20, 1781, Boswell found that Johnson had lately returned to wine. “I drink it now sometimes,” he said, “but not socially.” He seems to have generally abstained however. On April 20, 1781, he would not join in drinking Lichfield ale. On March 17, 1782, he made some punch for himself, by which in the night he thought “both his breast and imagination disordered” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i> page 205). In the spring of this year Hannah More urged him to take a little wine. “I can’t drink a <em>little</em>, child,” he answered; “therefore I never touch it” (H. More’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 251). On July 1, 1784, Beattie, who met him at dinner, says, “he cannot be prevailed on to drink wine” (Beattie’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 316). On his deathbed he refused any “inebriating sustenance” (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1784). It is remarkable that writing to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Taylor on <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 5, 1773, he said:⁠—“Drink a great deal, and sleep heartily;” and that on June 23, 1776, he again wrote to him:⁠—“I hope you presever in drinking. My opinion is that I have drunk too little, and therefore have the gout, for it is of my own acquisition, as neither my father had it nor my mother” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Notes and Queries</i>, 6th S. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> pages 422, 3). On <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 19, 1777 (<i>post</i>), he even “owned that in his opinion a free use of wine did not shorten life.” Johnson disapproved of fermented liquors only in the case of those who, like himself and Boswell, could not keep from excess. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-308" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Hawkins says that “Cave had few of those qualities that constitute the character of urbanity. Upon the first approach of a stranger his practice was to continue sitting, and for a few minutes to continue silent. If at any time he was inclined to begin the discourse, it was generally by putting a leaf of the Gentleman's Magazine then in the press into the hand of his visitor and asking his opinion of it. He was so incompetent a judge of Johnson’s abilities that, meaning at one time to dazzle him with the splendour of some of those luminaries in literature who favoured him with their correspondence, he told him that, if he would in the evening be at a certain alehouse in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, he might have a chance of seeing <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Browne and another or two of the persons mentioned in the preceding note. [The note contained the names of some of Cave’s regular writers.] Johnson accepted the invitation; and being introduced by Cave, dressed in a loose horseman’s coat, and such a great bushy uncombed wig as he constantly wore, to the sight of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Browne, whom he found sitting at the upper end of a long table, in a cloud of tobacco-smoke, had his curiosity gratified.” [<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Carlyle writes of “bushy-wigged Cave;” but it was Johnson whose wig is described, and not Cave’s. On page 327 Hawkins again mentions his “great bushy wig,” and says that “it was ever nearly as impenetrable by a comb as a quickset hedge.”] Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, pages 45⁠–⁠50. Johnson, after mentioning Cave’s slowness, says: “The same chillness of mind was observable in his conversation; he was watching the minutest accent of those whom he disgusted by seeming inattention; and his visitant was surprised, when he came a second time, by preparations to execute the scheme which he supposed never to have been heard.” Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 434. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-329" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Hail, <b>Urban</b>! indefatigable man,~~~Unwearied yet by all thy useful toil!~~~Whom num’rous slanderers assault in vain;~~~Whom no base calumny can put to foil.~~~But still the laurel on thy learned brow~~~Flourishes fair, and shall forever grow.</p>
					<p>“What mean the servile imitating crew,~~~What their vain blust’ring, and their empty noise,~~~Ne’er seek: but still thy noble ends pursue,~~~Unconquer’d by the rabble’s venal voice.~~~Still to the Muse thy studious mind apply,~~~Happy in temper as in industry.</p>
					<p>“The senseless sneerings of an haughty tongue,~~~Unworthy thy attention to engage,~~~Unheeded pass: and tho” they mean thee wrong,~~~By manly silence disappoint their rage.~~~Assiduous diligence confounds its foes,~~~Resistless, tho’ malicious crouds oppose.</p>
					<p>“Exert thy powers, nor slacken in the course,~~~Thy spotless fame shall quash all false reports:~~~Exert thy powers, nor fear a rival’s force,~~~But thou shalt smile at all his vain efforts;~~~Thy labours shall be crown’d with large success;~~~The Muse’s aid thy Magazine shall bless.</p>
					<p>“No page more grateful to th” harmonious nine~~~Than that wherein thy labours we survey;~~~Where solemn themes in fuller splendour shine,~~~(Delightful mixture,) blended with the gay,~~~Where in improving, various joys we find,~~~A welcome respite to the wearied mind.</p>
					<p>“Thus when the nymphs in some fair verdant mead,~~~Of various flowr’s a beauteous wreath compose,~~~The lovely violet’s azure-painted head~~~Adds lustre to the crimson-blushing rose.~~~Thus splendid Iris, with her varied dye,~~~Shines in the aether, and adorns the sky. <cite>—Briton</cite>.”</p>

					<p>Horace Walpole, writing of the year 1770, about libels, says: “Their excess was shocking, and in nothing more condemnable than in the dangers they brought on the liberty of the press.” This evil was chiefly due to “the spirit of the Court, which aimed at despotism, and the daring attempts of Lord Mansfield to stifle the liberty of the press.

					<p>Sir John Hawkins, page 86, tells us:⁠—“The event is <em>antedated</em>, in the poem of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>; but in every particular, except the difference of a year, what is there said of the departure of Thales, must be understood of Savage, and looked upon as <em>true history</em>.” This conjecture is, I believe, entirely groundless. I have been assured, that Johnson said he was not so much as acquainted with Savage when he wrote his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>. If the departure mentioned in it was the departure of Savage, the event was not <em>antedated</em> but <em>foreseen</em>; for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i> was published in May, 1738, and Savage did not set out for Wales till July, 1739. However well Johnson could defend the credibility of <em>second sight</em> [see <i>post</i>, <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 1766], he did not pretend that he himself was possessed of that faculty. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. I am not sure that Hawkins is altogether wrong in his account. Boswell does not state <em>of his own knowledge</em> that Johnson was not acquainted with Savage when he wrote <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>. The death of Queen Caroline in <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 1737 deprived Savage of her yearly bounty, and “abandoned him again to fortune” (Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 166). The elegy on her that he composed on her birthday (March 1) brought him no reward. He was “for some time in suspense,” but nothing was done. “He was in a short time reduced to the lowest degree of distress, and often wanted both lodging and food” (<i>Ib</i>. page 169). His friends formed a scheme that “he should retire into Wales.” “While this scheme was ripening” he lodged “in the liberties of the Fleet, that he might be secure from his creditors’ (<i>Ib</i>. page 170). After many delays a subscription was at length raised to provide him with a small pension, and he left London in July 1739 (<i>Ib</i>. p 173). <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>, as I have shown, was written before April 6, 1738. That it was written with great rapidity we might infer from the fact that a hundred lines of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Vanity of Human Wishes</i> were written in a day. At this rate <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i> might have been the work of three days. That it was written in a very short time seems to be shown by a passage in the first of these letters to Cave. Johnson says:⁠—“When I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago, I did not expect a repetition of the same pleasure so soon;⁠ ⁠… but having the enclosed poem, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>” It is probable that in these few days the poem was written. If we can assume that Savage’s elegy was sent to the Court not later than March 1⁠—it may have been sent earlier⁠—and that Johnson’s poem was written in the last ten days of March, we have three weeks for the intervening events. They are certainly not more than sufficient, if indeed they are sufficient. The coincidence is certainly very striking between Thales’s retirement to “Cambria’s solitary shore” and Savage’s retirement to Wales. There are besides lines in the poem⁠—additions to Juvenal and not translations⁠—which curiously correspond with what Johnson wrote of Savage in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>. Thus he says that Savage “imagined that he should be transported to scenes of flowery felicity;⁠ ⁠… he could not bear⁠ ⁠… to lose the opportunity of listening, without intermission, to the melody of the nightingale, which he believed was to be heard from every bramble, and which he did not fail to mention as a very important part of the happiness of a country life” (<i>Ib</i>. page 170). In like manner Thales prays to find:⁠—</p>
					<p>“Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play,~~~Some peaceful vale, with nature’s paintings gay.</p>
					<p>* * * * *</p>
					<p>There every bush with nature’s music rings;~~~There every breeze bears health upon its wings.”</p>
					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker objects that “if Thales had been Savage, Johnson could never have admitted into his poem two lines that point so forcibly at the drunken fray, in which Savage stabbed a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sinclair, for which he was convicted of <em>murder</em>:⁠—</p>
					<p>‘Some frolic <em>drunkard</em>, reeling from a feast, <em>Provokes</em> a broil, and <em>stabs</em> you in a jest.’ ”</p>
					<p>But here Johnson is following Juvenal. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker forgets that, if Savage was convicted of murder, “he was soon after admitted to bail, and pleaded the King’s pardon.” “Persons of distinction” testified that he was “a modest inoffensive man, not inclined to broils or to insolence;” the witnesses against him were of the lowest character, and his judge had shown himself as ignorant as he was brutal. Sinclair had been drinking in a brothel, and Savage asserted that he had stabbed him “by the necessity of self defence” (<i>Ib</i>. page 117). It is, however, not unlikely that Wales was suggested to Johnson as Thales’s retreat by Swift’s lines on Steele, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 181), published only three years before <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>:⁠—</p>

In spite, however, of Oglethorpe’s “strong benevolence of soul” he at one time treated Charles Wesley, who was serving as a missionary in Georgia, with great brutality (<i>Ib</i>. page 88). According to Benjamin Franklin (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 162) Georgia was settled with little forethought. “Instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen, it was with families of broken shopkeepers, and other insolvent debtors; many of idle habits, taken out of the jails, who being set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.” Johnson wished to write Oglethorpe’s life; <i>post</i>, April 10, 1775. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-367" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In a billet written by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pope in the following year, this school is said to have been in <em>Shropshire</em>; but as it appears from a letter from Earl Gower, that the trustees of it were “some worthy gentlemen in Johnson’s neighbourhood,” I in my first edition suggested that Pope must have, by mistake, written Shropshire, instead of Staffordshire. But I have since been obliged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Spearing, attorney-at-law, for the following information:⁠—“William Adams, formerly citizen and haberdasher of London, founded a school at Newport, in the county of Salop, by deed dated 27th November, 1656, by which he granted ‘the yearly sum of <em>sixty pounds</em> to such able and learned schoolmaster, from time to time, being of godly life and conversation, who should have been educated at one of the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, and had taken the degree of Master of Arts, and was well read in the Greek and Latin tongues, as should be nominated from time to time by the said William Adams, during his life, and after the decease of the said William Adams, by the Governours (namely, the Master and Wardens of the Haberdashers’ Company of the City of London) and their successors.’ The manour and lands out of which the revenues for the maintenance of the school were to issue are situate <em>at Knighton and Adbaston, in the county of Stafford</em>.” From the foregoing account of this foundation, particularly the circumstances of the salary being sixty pounds, and the degree of Master of Arts being a requisite qualification in the teacher, it seemed probable that this was the school in contemplation; and that Lord Gower erroneously supposed that the gentlemen who possessed the lands, out of which the revenues issued, were trustees of the charity.</p>
					<p>Such was probable conjecture. But in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for May, 1793, there is a letter from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Henn, one of the masters of the school of Appleby, in Leicestershire, in which he writes as follows:⁠—</p>
					<p>“I compared time and circumstance together, in order to discover whether the school in question might not be this of Appleby. Some of the trustees at that period were ‘worthy gentlemen of the neighbourhood of Litchfield.’ Appleby itself is not far from the neighbourhood of Litchfield. The salary, the degree requisite, together with the <em>time of election</em>, all agreeing with the statutes of Appleby. The election, as said in the letter, ‘could not be delayed longer than the 11th of next month,’ which was the 11th of September, just three months after the annual audit-day of Appleby school, which is always on the 11th of June; and the statutes enjoin <i xml:lang="la">ne ullius praeceptorum electio diutius tribus mensibus moraretur, etc</i>.</p>
					<p>“These I thought to be convincing proofs that my conjecture was not ill-founded, and that, in a future edition of that book, the circumstance might be recorded as fact.</p>
					<p>“But what banishes every shadow of doubt is the Minute-book of the school, which declares the headmastership to be <em>at that time</em> VACANT.”</p>

He stopped short in the publication, deterred perhaps by the threat of a prosecution for an infringement of copyright. “On all difficult occasions,” writes the Editor in 1787, “Johnson was Cave’s oracle; and the paper now before us was certainly written on that occasion.” Johnson argues that abridgments are not only legal but also justifiable. “The design of an abridgment is to benefit mankind by facilitating the attainment of knowledge⁠ ⁠… for as an incorrect book is lawfully criticised, and false assertions justly confuted⁠ ⁠… so a tedious volume may no less lawfully be abridged, because it is better that the proprietors should suffer some damage, than that the acquisition of knowledge should be obstructed with unnecessary difficulties, and the valuable hours of thousands thrown away.” Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 465.

					<p>According to Sir Joshua Reynolds, “Every person who knew <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson must have observed that the moment he was left out of the conversation, whether from his deafness or from whatever cause, but a few minutes without speaking or listening, his mind appeared to be preparing itself. He fell into a reverie accompanied with strange antic gestures; but this he never did when his mind was engaged by the conversation. These were therefore improperly called convulsions, which imply involuntary contortions; whereas, a word addressed to him, his attention was recovered. Sometimes, indeed, it would be near a minute before he would give an answer, looking as if he laboured to bring his mind to bear on the question” (Taylor’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 456). “I still, however, think,” wrote Boswell, “that these gestures were involuntary; for surely had not that been the case, he would have restrained them in the public streets’ (Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, under date of <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 11, 1773, note). <abbr>Dr.</abbr> T. Campbell, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary of a Visit to England</i>, page 33, writing of Johnson on March 16, 1775, says:⁠—“He has the aspect of an idiot, without the faintest ray of sense gleaming from any one feature⁠—with the most awkward garb, and unpowdered grey wig, on one side only of his head⁠—he is forever dancing the devil’s jig, and sometimes he makes the most driveling effort to whistle some thought in his absent paroxysms.” Miss Burney thus describes him when she first saw him in 1778:⁠—“Soon after we were seated this great man entered. I have so true a veneration for him that the very sight of him inspires me with delight and reverence, notwithstanding the cruel infirmities to which he is subject; for he has almost perpetual convulsive movements, either of his hands, lips, feet, or knees, and sometimes of all together.” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 63.

					<p>“Solitude,” wrote Reynolds, “to him was horror; nor would he ever trust himself alone but when employed in writing or reading.

					<p>Impartial posterity may, perhaps, be as little inclined as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson was to justify the uncommon rigour exercised in the case of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Archibald Cameron. He was an amiable and truly honest man; and his offence was owing to a generous, though mistaken principle of duty. Being obliged, after 1746, to give up his profession as a physician, and to go into foreign parts, he was honoured with the rank of Colonel, both in the French and Spanish service. He was a son of the ancient and respectable family of Cameron, of Lochiel; and his brother, who was the Chief of that brave clan, distinguished himself by moderation and humanity, while the Highland army marched victorious through Scotland. It is remarkable of this Chief, that though he had earnestly remonstrated against the attempt as hopeless, he was of too heroic a spirit not to venture his life and fortune in the cause, when personally asked by him whom he thought his prince. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.</p>

					<p>Sir John Hawkins gives the world to understand, that Johnson, “being an admirer of genteel manners, was captivated by the address and demeanour of Savage, who, as to his exterior, was, to a remarkable degree, accomplished.” Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 52. But Sir John’s notions of gentility must appear somewhat ludicrous, from his stating the following circumstance as presumptive evidence that Savage was a good swordsman: “That he understood the exercise of a gentleman’s weapon, may be inferred from the use made of it in that rash encounter which is related in his life.” The dexterity here alluded to was, that Savage, in a nocturnal fit of drunkenness, stabbed a man at a coffeehouse, and killed him; for which he was tried at the Old-Bailey, and found guilty of murder.</p>

Yet it is not easy to understand how, if there was a lodging for her, there was not one for him. She might have been living with friends. We have a statement by Hawkins (page 89) that there was “a temporary separation of Johnson from his wife.” He adds that, “while he was in a lodging in Fleet Street, she was harboured by a friend near the Tower.” This separation, he insinuates, rose by an estrangement caused by Johnson’s “indifference in the discharge of the domestic virtues.” It is far more likely that it rose from destitution.</p>
					<p>Shenstone, in a letter written in 1743, gives a curious account of the streets of London through which Johnson wandered.

					<p>“<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Bastard</i>: A poem, inscribed with all due reverence to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bret, once Countess of Macclesfield. By Richard Savage, son of the late Earl Rivers. London, printed for T. Worrall, 1728.” Fol. first edition. <cite>—P. Cunningham</cite>. Between Savage’s character, as drawn by Johnson, and Johnson himself there are many points of likeness. Each “always preserved a steady confidence in his own capacity,” and of each it might be said:⁠—“Whatever faults may be imputed to him, the virtue of suffering well cannot be denied him.” Each “excelled in the arts of conversation and therefore willingly practised them.” In Savage’s refusal to enter a house till some clothes had been taken away that had been left for him “with some neglect of ceremonies,” we have the counterpart of Johnson’s throwing away the new pair of shoes that had been set at his door. Of Johnson the following lines are as true as of Savage:⁠—“His distresses, however afflictive, never dejected him; in his lowest state he wanted not spirit to assert the natural dignity of wit, and was always ready to repress that insolence which the superiority of fortune incited;⁠ ⁠… he never admitted any gross familiarities, or submitted to be treated otherwise than as an equal.” Of both men it might be said that “it was in no time of his life any part of his character to be the first of the company that desired to separate.” Each “would prolong his conversation till midnight, without considering that business might require his friend’s application in the morning;” and each could plead the same excuse that, “when he left his company, he was abandoned to gloomy reflections.” Each had the same “accurate judgment,” the same “quick apprehension,” the same “tenacious memory.” In reading such lines as the following who does not think, not of the man whose biography was written, but of the biographer himself?⁠—“He had the peculiar felicity that his attention never deserted him; he was present to every object, and regardful of the most trifling occurrences⁠ ⁠… To this quality is to be imputed the extent of his knowledge, compared with the small time which he spent in visible endeavours to acquire it. He mingled in cursory conversation with the same steadiness of attention as others apply to a lecture.⁠ ⁠… His judgment was eminently exact both with regard to writings and to men. The knowledge of life was indeed his chief attainment.” Of Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i>, as of Savage’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Wanderer</i>, it might equally well be said:⁠—“Nor can it without some degree of indignation and concern be told that he sold the copy for ten guineas.” <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-485" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The story on which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cust so much relies, that Savage was a supposititious child, not the son of Lord Rivers and Lady Macclesfield, but the offspring of a shoemaker, introduced in consequence of her real son’s death, was, without doubt, grounded on the circumstance of Lady Macclesfield having, in 1696, previously to the birth of Savage, had a daughter by the Earl Rivers, who died in her infancy; a fact which was proved in the course of the proceedings on Lord Macclesfield’s Bill of Divorce. Most fictions of this kind have some admixture of truth in them. <cite>—Malone</cite>. From <i epub:type="se:name.legal-case">The Earl of Macclesfield’s Case</i>, it appears that “Anne, Countess of Macclesfield, under the name of Madam Smith, in Fox Court, near Brook Street, Holborn, was delivered of a male child on the 16th of January, 1696⁠–⁠7, who was baptized on the Monday following, the 18th, and registered by the name of Richard, the son of John Smith, by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burbridge; and, from the privacy, was supposed by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Burbridge to be ‘a by-blow or bastard.’ ” It also appears, that during her delivery, the lady wore a mask; and that Mary Pegler, on the next day after the baptism, took a male child, whose mother was called Madam Smith, from the house of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Pheasant, in Fox Court [running from Brook Street in Gray’s Inn Lane], who went by the name of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lee.</p>
					<p>Conformable to this statement is the entry in the register of <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrew’s, Holborn, which is as follows, and which unquestionably records the baptism of Richard Savage, to whom Lord Rivers gave his own Christian name, prefixed to the assumed surname of his mother:⁠—“<abbr>Jan.</abbr> 1696⁠–⁠7. Richard, son of John Smith and Mary, in Fox Court, in Gray’s Inn Lane, baptized the 18th.” <cite>—Bindley</cite>. According to Johnson’s account Savage did not learn who his parents were till the death of his nurse, who had always treated him as her son.

					<p>Trusting to Savage’s information, Johnson represents this unhappy man’s being received as a companion by Lord Tyrconnel, and pensioned by his Lordship, as if posteriour to Savage’s conviction and pardon. But I am assured, that Savage had received the voluntary bounty of Lord Tyrconnel, and had been dismissed by him, long before the murder was committed, and that his Lordship was very instrumental in procuring Savage’s pardon, by his intercession with the Queen, through Lady Hertford. If, therefore, he had been desirous of preventing the publication by Savage, he would have left him to his fate. Indeed I must observe, that although Johnson mentions that Lord Tyrconnel’s patronage of Savage was “upon his promise to lay aside his design of exposing the cruelty of his mother,” [Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 124], the great biographer has forgotten that he himself has mentioned, that Savage’s story had been told several years before in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Plain Dealer</i>; from which he quotes this strong saying of the generous Sir Richard Steele, that “the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father.” [<i>Ib</i>. page 104.] At the same time it must be acknowledged, that Lady Macclesfield and her relations might still wish that her story should not be brought into more conspicuous notice by the satirical pen of Savage. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-506" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“When you see <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson pray [give] my compliments, and tell him I esteem him as a great genius⁠—quite lost both to himself and the world.” Gilbert Walmesley to Garrick, <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 3, 1746. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Garrick Correspondence</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 45. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Walmesley’s letter does not show that Johnson was idle. The old man had expected great things from him. “I have great hopes,” he had written in 1737 (see <a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-102">here</a>), “that he will turn out a fine tragedy writer.” In the nine years in which Johnson had been in town he had done, no doubt, much admirable work; but by his poem of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">London</i> only was he known to the public. His <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Savage</i> did not bear his name. His <i epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">Observations on Macbeth</i> were published in April, 1745; his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.pamphlet">Plan of the Dictionary</i> in 1747 [Transcriber’s note: Originally 1774, corrected in Errata.]. What was Johnson doing meanwhile? Boswell conjectures that he was engaged on his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Shakespeare</i> and his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dictionary</i>. That he went on working at his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Shakespeare</i> when the prospect of publishing was so remote that he could not issue his proposals is very unlikely. That he had been for some time engaged on his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dictionary</i> before he addressed Lord Chesterfield is shown by the opening sentences of the Hayward’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.pamphlet">Plan</i>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker’s conjecture that he was absent or concealed on account of some difficulties which had arisen through the rebellion of 1745 is absurd. At no time of his life had he been an ardent Jacobite. “I have heard him declare,” writes Boswell, “that if holding up his right hand would have secured victory at Culloden to Prince Charles’s army, he was not sure he would have held it up;” <i>post</i>, July 14, 1763. “He had never in his life been in a nonjuring meetinghouse;” <i>post</i>, June 9, 1784.</p>
					<p>For the fact that he wrote very little, if indeed anything, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> during these years more than one reason may be given. In the first place, public affairs take up an unusual amount of room in its columns. Thus in the number for <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1745 we read:⁠—“Our readers being too much alarmed by the present rebellion to relish with their usual delight the <em>Debates in the Senate of Lilliput</em> we shall postpone them for a season, that we may be able to furnish out a fuller entertainment of what we find to be more suitable to their present taste.” In the Preface it is stated:⁠—“We have sold more of our books than we desire for several months past, and are heartily sorry for the occasion of it, the present troubles.” During these years then much less space was given to literature. But besides this, Johnson likely enough refused to write for the Gentleman's Magazine when it showed itself strongly Hanoverian. He would highly disapprove of “A New Protestant Litany”, which was written after the following fashion:⁠—</p>
					<p>“May Spaniards, or French, all who join with a Highland,~~~In disturbing the peace of this our bless’d island,~~~Meet tempests on sea and halters on dry land.~~~We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord.”</p>
					<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> 551.</p>
					<p>He would be disgusted the following year at seeing the Duke of Cumberland praised as “the greatest man alive” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> 235), and sung in verse that would have almost disgraced Cibber (page 36). It is remarkable that there is no mention of Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.pamphlet">Plan of a Dictionary</i> in the Gentleman's Magazine.

					<p>Boswell, it is clear, has taken his account of the club from Hawkins, who writes:⁠—“Johnson had, in the winter of 1749, formed a club that met weekly at the King’s Head, a famous beefsteak house in Ivy Lane, near <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s, every Tuesday evening. Thither he constantly resorted with a disposition to please and be pleased. Our conversations seldom began till after a supper so very solid and substantial as led us to think that with him it was a dinner.</p>
					<p>“By the help of this refection, and no other incentive to hilarity than lemonade, Johnson was in a short time after our assembling transformed into a new creature; his habitual melancholy and lassitude of spirit gave way; his countenance brightened.” Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, pages 219, 250. Other parts of Hawkins’s account do not agree with passages in Johnson’s letters to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale written in 1783⁠–⁠4. “I dined about a fortnight ago with three old friends [Hawkins, Ryland, and Payne]; we had not met together for thirty years. In the thirty years two of our set have died.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 339. “We used to meet weekly about the year fifty.” <i>Ib</i>. page 361. “The people whom I mentioned in my letter are the remnant of a little club that used to meet in Ivy Lane about three and thirty years ago, out of which we have lost Hawkesworth and Dyer, the rest are yet on this side the grave.” <i>Ib</i>. page 363. Hawkins says the club broke up about 1756 (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 361). Johnson in the first of the passages says they had not met at all for thirty years⁠—that is to say, not since 1753; while in the last two passages he implies that their weekly meetings came to an end about 1751.

If Garrick was aimed at, it is surprising that the severity of the satire did not bring to an end, not only all friendship, but even any acquaintance between the two men. The writer describes how he and Prospero had set out in the world together, and how for a long time they had assisted each other, till his friend had been lately raised to wealth by a lucky project. “I felt at his sudden shoot of success an honest and disinterested joy.” Prospero reproached him with his neglect to visit him at his new house. When however he went to see him, he found that his friend’s impatience “arose not from any desire to communicate his happiness, but to enjoy his superiority.” He was kept waiting at the door, and when at length he was shown upstairs, he found the staircase carefully secured by mats from the pollution of his feet. Prospero led him into a backroom, where he told him he always breakfasted when he had not great company.

Prospero then told me that another time I should taste his finest sort, but that he had only a very small quantity remaining, and reserved it for those whom he thought himself obliged to treat with particular respect.” See <i>post</i>, April 10, 1778, where Johnson maintained that Garrick bore his good-fortune with modesty. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-646" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Johnson turned his house,” writes Lord Macaulay, “into a place of refuge for a crowd of wretched old creatures who could find no other asylum; nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude weary out his benevolence” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 390). In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Biography of Johnson</i> (page 388) he says that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams’s “chief recommendations were her blindness and her poverty.” No doubt in Johnson’s letters to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale are found amusing accounts of the discord of the inmates of his house. But it is abundantly clear that in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams’s company he had for years found pleasure. A few months after her death he wrote to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale: “You have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude, when you hear that I am crowded with visits. <i xml:lang="la">Inopem me copia fecit</i>. Visitors are no proper companions in the chamber of sickness.⁠ ⁠… The amusements and consolations of languor and depression are conferred by familiar and domestic companions.⁠ ⁠… Such society I had with Levett and Williams’ (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 341). To <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu he wrote:⁠—“Thirty years and more she had been my companion, and her death has left me very desolate” (Croker’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Boswell</i>, page 739). Boswell says that “her departure left a blank in his house” (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 1783). “By her death,” writes Murphy, “he was left in a state of destitution, with nobody but his black servant to soothe his anxious moments’ (Murphy’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, page 122). Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 558) says that “she had not only cheered him in his solitude, and helped him to pass with comfort those hours which otherwise would have been irksome to him, but had relieved him from domestic cares, regulated and watched over the expenses of his house, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>” “She had,” as Boswell says (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 1783), “valuable qualities.” “Had she had,” wrote Johnson, “good humour and prompt elocution, her universal curiosity and comprehensive knowledge would have made her the delight of all that knew her” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 311). To Langton he wrote:⁠—“I have lost a companion to whom I have had recourse for domestic amusement for thirty years, and whose variety of knowledge never was exhausted” (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 29, 1783). “Her acquisitions,” he wrote to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney, “were many and her curiosity universal; so that she partook of every conversation” (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 1783). Murphy (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i> page 72) says:⁠—“She possessed uncommon talents, and, though blind, had an alacrity of mind that made her conversation agreeable, and even desirable.” According to Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, 322⁠–⁠4) “she had acquired a knowledge of French and Italian, and had made great improvements in literature. She was a woman of an enlightened understanding. Johnson in many exigencies found her an able counsellor, and seldom showed his wisdom more than when he hearkened to her advice.” Perhaps Johnson had her in his thoughts when, writing of Pope’s last years and Martha Blount, he said:⁠—“Their acquaintance began early; the life of each was pictured on the other’s mind; their conversation therefore was endearing, for when they met there was an immediate coalition of congenial notions.” (Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 304.) Miss Mulso (<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chapone) writing to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carter in 1753, says:⁠—“I was charmed with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson’s behaviour to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams, which was like that of a fond father to his daughter. She showed very good sense, with a great deal of modesty and humility; and so much patience and cheerfulness under her misfortune that it doubled my concern for her” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Chapone’s Life</i>, page 73). Miss Talbot wrote to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Carter in 1756:⁠—“My mother the other day fell in love with your friend, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams, whom we met at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richardson’s [where Miss Mulso also had met her], and is particularly charmed with the sweetness of her voice” (Talbot and Carter <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Correspondence</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 221). Miss Talbot was a niece of Lord Chancellor Talbot. Hannah More wrote in 1774:⁠—“<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams is engaging in her manners; her conversation lively and entertaining” (More’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 49). Boswell, however, more than once complains that she was “peevish” (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 26, 1769 and April 7, 1776). At a time when she was very ill, and had gone into the country to try if she could improve her health, Johnson wrote:⁠—“Age, and sickness, and pride have made her so peevish, that I was forced to bribe the maid to stay with her by a secret stipulation of half-a-crown a week over her wages’ (<i>post</i>, July 22, 1777). Malone, in a note on August 2, 1763, says that he thinks she had of her own “about £35 or £40 a year.” This was in her latter days; Johnson had prevailed on Garrick to give her a benefit and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu to give her a pension.

In youth we have nothing past to entertain us, and in age we derive little from retrospect but hopeless sorrow. Yet the future likewise has its limits which the imagination dreads to approach, but which we see to be not far distant. The loss of our friends and companions impresses hourly upon us the necessity of our own departure; we know that the schemes of man are quickly at an end, that we must soon lie down in the grave with the forgotten multitudes of former ages, and yield our place to others, who, like us, shall be driven a while by hope or fear about the surface of the earth, and then like us be lost in the shades of death.” In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i>, pages 12⁠–⁠15, in a service that he used on May 6, “as preparatory to my return to life tomorrow,” he prays:⁠—“Enable me to begin and perfect that reformation which I promised her, and to persevere in that resolution which she implored Thee to continue, in the purposes which I recorded in Thy sight when she lay dead before me.” See <i>post</i>, <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 20, 1780.

This is the day on which, in 1752, I was deprived of poor, dear Tetty.⁠ ⁠… When I recollect the time in which we lived together, my grief for her departure is not abated; and I have less pleasure in any good that befalls me because she does not partake it.” P. 170: “April 20, 1778.

					<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bathurst, though a Physician of no inconsiderable merit, had not the good fortune to get much practice in London.

					<p>The account given of Levet in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> lv. 101, shows that he was a man out of the common run. He would not otherwise have attracted the notice of the French surgeons. The writer says:⁠—“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Levet, though an Englishman by birth, became early in life a waiter at a coffeehouse in Paris. The surgeons who frequented it, finding him of an inquisitive turn and attentive to their conversation, made a purse for him, and gave him some instructions in their art. They afterwards furnished him with the means of further knowledge, by procuring him free admission to such lectures in pharmacy and anatomy as were read by the ablest professors of that period.” When he lived with Johnson, “much of the day was employed in attendance on his patients, who were chiefly of the lowest rank of tradesmen. The remainder of his hours he dedicated to Hunter’s lectures, and to as many different opportunities of improvement as he could meet with on the same gratuitous conditions.” “All his medical knowledge,” said Johnson, “and it is not inconsiderable, was obtained through the ear. Though he buys books, he seldom looks into them, or discovers any power by which he can be supposed to judge of an author’s merit.” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson has frequently observed that Levet was indebted to him for nothing more than houseroom, his share in a penny-loaf at breakfast, and now and then a dinner on a Sunday. His character was rendered valuable by repeated proof of honesty, tenderness, and gratitude to his benefactor, as well as by an unwearied diligence in his profession. His single failing was an occasional departure from sobriety. Johnson would observe, ‘he was perhaps the only man who ever became intoxicated through motives of prudence. He reflected that, if he refused the gin or brandy offered him by some of his patients, he could have been no gainer by their cure, as they might have had nothing else to bestow on him. This habit of taking a fee, in whatever shape it was exhibited, could not be put off by advice. He would swallow what he did not like, nay what he knew would injure him, rather than go home with an idea that his skill had been exerted without recompense. Though he took all that was offered him, he demanded nothing from the poor.’ ” The writer adds that “Johnson never wished him to be regarded as an inferior, or treated him like a dependent.” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi says:⁠—“When Johnson raised contributions for some distressed author, or wit in want, he often made us all more than amends by diverting descriptions of the lives they were then passing in corners unseen by anybody but himself, and that odd old surgeon whom he kept in his house to tend the outpensioners, and of whom he said most truly and sublimely, that</p>

					<p>“We are both of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s school,” wrote Reynolds to some friend. “For my own part, I acknowledge the highest obligations to him.

There are many such men in this age: and they will be pleased with communicating their ideas to artists, when they see them curious and docile, if they are treated with that respect and deference which is so justly their due. Into such society young artists, if they make it the point of their ambition, will by degrees be admitted. There, without formal teaching, they will insensibly come to feel and reason like those they live with, and find a rational and systematic taste imperceptibly formed in their minds, which they will know how to reduce to a standard, by applying general truth to their own purposes, better perhaps than those to whom they owned [?owed] the original sentiment.” Reynolds’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, edit. 1824, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 149. “Another thing remarkable to show how little Sir Joshua crouched to the great is, that he never gave them their proper titles.

But Chesterfield did worse than this. By way of recommending a work of so much learning and so much labour he tells a foolish story of an assignation that had failed “between a fine gentleman and a fine lady.” The letter that had passed between them had been badly spelt, and they had gone to different houses. “Such examples,” he wrote, “really make one tremble; and will, I am convinced, determine my fair fellow-subjects and their adherents to adopt and scrupulously conform to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson’s rules of true orthography.” Johnson, in the last year of his life, at a time of great weakness and depression, defended the roughness of his manner. “I have done more good as I am.

					<p>That collection of letters cannot be vindicated from the serious charge of encouraging, in some passages, one of the vices most destructive to the good order and comfort of society, which his Lordship represents as mere fashionable gallantry; and, in others, of inculcating the base practice of dissimulation, and recommending, with disproportionate anxiety, a perpetual attention to external elegance of manners. But it must, at the same time, be allowed, that they contain many good precepts of conduct, and much genuine information upon life and manners, very happily expressed; and that there was considerable merit in paying so much attention to the improvement of one who was dependent upon his Lordship’s protection; it has, probably, been exceeded in no instance by the most exemplary parent; and though I can by no means approve of confounding the distinction between lawful and illicit offspring, which is, in effect, insulting the civil establishment of our country, to look no higher; I cannot help thinking it laudable to be kindly attentive to those, of whose existence we have, in any way, been the cause. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Stanhope’s character has been unjustly represented as diametrically opposite to what Lord Chesterfield wished him to be.

					<p>In another work (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson: His Friends and His Critics</i>, page 214), I have shown that Lord Chesterfield’s “Respectable Hottentot” was not Johnson. From the beginning of 1748 to the end of 1754 Chesterfield had no dealings of any kind with Johnson. At no time had there been the slightest intimacy between the great nobleman and the poor author. Chesterfield had never seen Johnson eat. The letter in which the character is drawn opens with the epigram:</p>
					<p>Non amo te, Sabidi, nee possum dicere quare,~~~Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.</p>
					<p>Chesterfield goes on to show “how it is possible not to love anybody, and yet not to know the reason why.⁠ ⁠… How often,” he says, “have I, in the course of my life, found myself in this situation with regard to many of my acquaintance whom I have honoured and respected, without being able to love.” He then instances the case of the man whom he describes as a respectable Hottentot. It is clear that he is writing of a man whom he knows well and who has some claim upon his affection. Twice he says that it is impossible to love him. The date of this letter is <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 28, 1751, more than three years after Johnson had for the last time waited in Chesterfield’s outward rooms. Moreover the same man is described in three other letters (<abbr>Sept.</abbr> 22, 1749; <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 1749; and May 27, 1753), and described as one with whom Chesterfield lived on terms of intimacy. In the two former of these letters he is called <abbr>Mr.</abbr> L. Lyttelton did not become Sir George Lyttelton till <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 14, 1751. He was raised to the peerage in 1757.

But it did not come before the world till twenty-three years later, when Johnson’s quarrel with Chesterfield was known to everyone, when Johnson himself was at the very head of the literary world, and when his peculiarities had become a matter of general interest. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-785" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I presume she was a relation of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Zachariah Williams, who died in his eighty-third year, July 12, 1755. When <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson was with me at Oxford, in 1755, he gave to the Bodleian Library a thin quarto of twenty-one pages, a work in Italian, with an English translation on the opposite page. The English titlepage is this: “An Account of an Attempt to ascertain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Variation of the Magnetical Needle, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> By Zachariah Williams. London, printed for Dodsley, 1755.” The English translation, from the strongest internal marks, is unquestionably the work of Johnson. In a blank leaf, Johnson has written the age, and time of death, of the author Z. Williams, as I have said above. On another blank leaf, is pasted a paragraph from a newspaper, of the death and character of Williams, which is plainly written by Johnson.

					<p>He thus defines Excise: “A hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by those to whom Excise is paid.” The Commissioners of Excise being offended by this severe reflection, consulted <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murray, then Attorney General, to know whether redress could be legally obtained.

					<p>Some time after <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s death there appeared in the newspapers and magazines an illiberal and petulant attack upon him, in the form of an Epitaph, under the name of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Soame Jenyns, very unworthy of that gentleman, who had quietly submitted to the critical lash while Johnson lived. It assumed, as characteristics of him, all the vulgar circumstances of abuse which had circulated amongst the ignorant. It was an unbecoming indulgence of puny resentment, at a time when he himself was at a very advanced age, and had a near prospect of descending to the grave. I was truly sorry for it; for he was then become an avowed, and (as my Lord Bishop of London, who had a serious conversation with him on the subject, assures me) a sincere Christian. He could not expect that Johnson’s numerous friends would patiently bear to have the memory of their master stigmatized by no mean pen, but that, at least, one would be found to retort. Accordingly, this unjust and sarcastic Epitaph was met in the same public field by an answer, in terms by no means soft, and such as wanton provocation only could justify:</p>
					<p>“<b>Epitaph</b>,<!-- header --></p>
					<p>“<em>Prepared for a creature</em> not quite dead <em>yet</em>.</p>
					<p>“Here lies a little ugly nauseous elf,~~~Who judging only from its wretched self,~~~Feebly attempted, petulant and vain,~~~The ‘Origin of Evil’ to explain.~~~A mighty Genius at this elf displeas’d,~~~With a strong critic grasp the urchin squeez’d.~~~For thirty years its coward spleen it kept,~~~Till in the duat the mighty Genius slept;~~~Then stunk and fretted in expiring snuff,~~~And blink’d at <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Johnson</b> with its last poor puff.”</p>

					<p>Northcote gives the following account of this same garret in describing how Reynolds introduced Roubiliac to Johnson. “Johnson received him with much civility, and took them up into a garret, which he considered as his library; where, besides his books, all covered with dust, there was an old crazy deal table, and a still worse and older elbow chair, having only three legs.

She says that “before Johnson had the pension he literally dressed like a beggar; and, from what I have been told, he as literally lived as such; at least as to common conveniences in his apartments, wanting even a chair to sit on, particularly in his study, where a gentleman who frequently visited him, whilst writing his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Idlers</i>, constantly found him at his desk, sitting on one with three legs; and on rising from it, he remarked that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson never forgot its defect, but would either hold it in his hand, or place it with great composure against some support, taking no notice of its imperfection to his visitor.

					<p>We may apply to Johnson in his behaviour to his mother what he said of Pope in his behaviour to his parents:⁠—“Whatever was his pride, to them he was obedient; and whatever was his irritability, to them he was gentle.

It has come, and is past. The life which made my own life pleasant is at an end, and the gates of death are shut upon my prospects.⁠ ⁠… Such is the condition of our present existence that life must one time lose its associations, and every inhabitant of the earth must walk downward to the grave alone and unregarded, without any partner of his joy or grief, without any interested witness of his misfortunes or success. Misfortune, indeed, he may yet feel; for where is the bottom of the misery of man? But what is success to him that has none to enjoy it? Happiness is not found in self-contemplation; it is perceived only when it is reflected from another.” In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rasselas</i> (chapter xlv.) he makes a sage say with a sigh:⁠—“Praise is to have an old man an empty sound. I have neither mother to be delighted with the reputation of her son, nor wife to partake the honours of her husband.” He here says once more what he had already said in his Letter to Lord Chesterfield (<i>ante</i>, page 261), and in the Preface to the Dictionary (<i>ante</i>, page 297). <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1018" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Writing to his Birmingham friend, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hector, on <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 7, 1756, he said:⁠—“I have been thinking every month of coming down into the country, but every month has brought its hinderances. From that kind of melancholy indisposition which I had when we lived together at Birmingham I have never been free, but have always had it operating against my health and my life with more or less violence.

No doubt his constant poverty and the need that he was under of making “provision for the day that was passing over him” had had much to do in keeping him from a journey to Lichfield. A passage in one of his letters shows that fourteen years later the stagecoach took twenty-six hours in going from London to Lichfield. (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 55.) The return journey was very uncertain; for “our carriages,” he wrote, “are only such as pass through the place sometimes full and sometimes vacant.” A traveller had to watch for a place (<i>ib</i>. page 51).

They have already seen essays, for which a very large price is paid, transferred, with the most shameless rapacity, into the weekly or monthly compilations, and their right, at least for the present, alienated from them, before they could themselves be said to enjoy it. But they would not willingly be thought to want tenderness, even for men by whom no tenderness hath been shown. The past is without remedy, and shall be without resentment. But those who have been thus busy with their sickles in the fields of their neighbours, are henceforward to take notice, that the time of impunity is at an end. Whoever shall, without our leave, lay the hand of rapine upon our papers, is to expect that we shall vindicate our due, by the means which justice prescribes, and which are warranted by the immemorial prescriptions of honourable trade. We shall lay hold, in our turn, on their copies, degrade them from the pomp of wide margin and diffuse typography, contract them into a narrow space, and sell them at an humble price; yet not with a view of growing rich by confiscations, for we think not much better of money got by punishment than by crimes. We shall, therefore, when our losses are repaid, give what profit shall remain to the <em>Magdalens</em>; for we know not who can be more properly taxed for the support of penitent prostitutes, than prostitutes in whom there yet appears neither penitence nor shame.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1037" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I think that this letter belongs to a later date, probably to 1765 or 1766. As we learn, <i>post</i>, April 10, 1776, Simpson was a barrister “who fell into a dissipated course of life.” On July 2, 1765, Johnson records that he repaid him ten guineas which he had borrowed in the lifetime of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Johnson (his wife). He also lent him ten guineas more. If it was in 1759 that Simpson was troubled by small debts, it is most unlikely that Johnson let six years more pass without repaying him a loan which even then was at least of seven years’ standing. Moreover, in this letter Johnson writes:⁠—“I have been invited, or have invited myself, to several parts of the kingdom.” The only visits, it seems, that he paid between 1754⁠–⁠1762 were to Oxford in 1759 and to Lichfield in the winter of 1761⁠–⁠2. After 1762, when his pension gave him means, he travelled frequently. Besides all this, he says of his stepdaughter:⁠—“I will not incommode my dear Lucy by coming to Lichfield, while her present lodging is of any use to her.” Miss Porter seems to have lived in his house till she had built one for herself. Though his letter to her of <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 10, 1764 (Croker’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Boswell</i>, page 163), shows that it was then building, yet she had not left his house on <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 14, 1766 (<i>ib</i>. page 173). <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1038" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He retired to Gray’s-Inn, [he had first moved to Staple Inn], and soon removed to chambers in the Inner Temple-lane, where he lived in poverty, total idleness, and the pride of literature, <i xml:lang="la">Magni stat nominis umbra</i>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fitzherbert used to say that he paid a morning visit to Johnson, intending from his chambers to send a letter into the city; but, to his great surprise, he found an author by profession without pen, ink, or paper.” (It was <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fitzherbert, who sent Johnson some wine. See <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-892">this note</a>. See also <i>post</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 15, 1777). The following documents confirm Murphy’s statement of Johnson’s poverty at this time:</p>
					<p>“May 19, 1759.</p>
					<p>“I promise to pay to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Newbery the sum of forty-two pounds, nineteen shillings, and ten pence on demand, value received. £42 19 10.</p>
					<p>“Sam. Johnson.”</p>
					<p>“March 20, 1760.</p>
					<p>“I promise to pay to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Newbery the sum of thirty pounds upon demand., £30 0 0.</p>
					<p>“Sam. Johnson.”</p>
					<p>In 1751 he had thrice borrowed money of Newbery, but the total amount of the loans was only four guineas. Prior’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Goldsmith</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 340. With Johnson’s want of pen, ink, and paper we may compare the account that he gives of Savage’s destitution (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 3):⁠—“Nor had he any other conveniences for study than the fields or the streets allowed him; there he used to walk and form his speeches, and afterwards step into a shop, beg for a few moments the use of the pen and ink, and write down what he had composed upon paper which he had picked up by accident.” Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 383) says that Johnson’s chambers were two doors down the Inner Temple Lane. “I have been told,” he continues, “by his neighbour at the corner, that during the time he dwelt there, more inquiries were made at his shop for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson, than for all the inhabitants put together of both the Inner and Middle Temple.” In a court opening out of Fleet Street, Goldsmith at this very time was still more miserably lodged. In the beginning of March 1759, Percy found him “employed in writing his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Enquiry into Polite Learning</i> in a wretched dirty room, in which there was but one chair, and when he from civility offered it to his visitant, himself was obliged to sit in the window.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Goldsmith’s <abbr>Misc.</abbr> Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 61. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1050" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Sir John Hawkins (Life, page 373) has given a long detail of it, in that manner vulgarly, but significantly, called rigmarole; in which, amidst an ostentatious exhibition of arts and artists, he talks of “proportions of a column being taken from that of the human figure, and <em>adjusted by Nature</em>⁠—masculine and feminine⁠—in a man, sesquioctave of the head, and in a woman <em>sesquinonal</em>;” nor has he failed to introduce a jargon of musical terms, which do not seem much to correspond with the subject, but serve to make up the heterogeneous mass. To follow the Knight through all this, would be an useless fatigue to myself, and not a little disgusting to my readers. I shall, therefore, only make a few remarks upon his statement.⁠—He seems to exult in having detected Johnson in procuring “from a person eminently skilled in Mathematics and the principles of architecture, answers to a string of questions drawn up by himself, touching the comparative strength of semicircular and elliptical arches.” Now I cannot conceive how Johnson could have acted more wisely. Sir John complains that the opinion of that excellent mathematician, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thomas Simpson, did not preponderate in favour of the semicircular arch. But he should have known, that however eminent <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Simpson was in the higher parts of abstract mathematical science, he was little versed in mixed and practical mechanics. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Muller, of Woolwich Academy, the scholastic father of all the great engineers which this country has employed for forty years, decided the question by declaring clearly in favour of the elliptical arch.</p>
					<p>It is ungraciously suggested, that Johnson’s motive for opposing <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mylne’s scheme may have been his prejudice against him as a native of North Britain; when, in truth, as has been stated, he gave the aid of his able pen to a friend, who was one of the candidates; and so far was he from having any illiberal antipathy to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mylne, that he afterwards lived with that gentleman upon very agreeable terms of acquaintance, and dined with him at his house. Sir John Hawkins, indeed, gives full vent to his own prejudice in abusing Blackfriars bridge, calling it “an edifice, in which beauty and symmetry are in vain sought for; by which the citizens of London have perpetuated study their own disgrace, and subjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners.” Whoever has contemplated, <i xml:lang="la">placido lumine</i> [Horace, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Odes</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 3, 2], this stately, elegant, and airy structure, which has so fine an effect, especially on approaching the capital on that quarter, must wonder at such unjust and ill-tempered censure; and I appeal to all foreigners of good taste, whether this bridge be not one of the most distinguished ornaments of London. As to the stability of the fabric, it is certain that the City of London took every precaution to have the best Portland stone for it; but as this is to be found in the quarries belonging to the public, under the direction of the Lords of the Treasury, it so happened that parliamentary interest, which is often the bane of fair pursuits, thwarted their endeavours. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, it is well known that not only has Blackfriars-bridge never sunk either in its foundation or in its arches, which were so much the subject of contest, but any injuries which it has suffered from the effects of severe frosts have been already, in some measure, repaired with sounder stone, and every necessary renewal can be completed at a moderate expense. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Horace Walpole mentions an ineffectual application made by the City to Parliament in 1764 “for more money for their new bridge at Blackfriars,” when <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hay, one of the Lords of the Admiralty, “abused the Common Council, whose late behaviour, he said, entitled them to no favour.” Walpole’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs of the Reign of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 390. The late behaviour was the part taken by the City in Wilkes’s case. It was the same love of liberty no doubt that lost the City the Portland stone. Smollett goes out of the way to praise his brother-Scot, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mylne, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Humphry Clinker</i>⁠—“a party novel written,” says Horace Walpole, “to vindicate the Scots’ (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reign of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 328).

					<p>In this Introduction (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 148) Johnson answers objections that had been raised against the relief. “We know that for the prisoners of war there is no legal provision; we see their distress and are certain of its cause; we know that they are poor and naked, and poor and naked without a crime.⁠ ⁠… The opponents of this charity must allow it to be good, and will not easily prove it not to be the best. That charity is best of which the consequences are most extensive; the relief of enemies has a tendency to unite mankind in fraternal affection.” The Committee for which Johnson’s paper was written began its work in <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1759. In the previous month of October Wesley records in his _Journal (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 461):⁠—“I walked up to Knowle, a mile from Bristol, to see the French prisoners. Above eleven hundred of them, we were informed, were confined in that little place, without anything to lie on but a little dirty straw, or anything to cover them but a few foul thin rags, either by day or by night, so that they died like rotten sheep. I was much affected, and preached in the evening on <i>Exodus</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIII</span> 9.” Money was at once contributed, and clothing bought. “It was not long before contributions were set on foot in various parts of the Kingdom.” On <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 24 of the following year, he records:⁠—“I visited the French prisoners at Knowle, and found many of them almost naked again.” <i>Ib</i>. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 23. “The prisoners,” wrote Hume (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Private Correspondence</i> page 55), “received food from the public, but it was thought that their own friends would supply them with clothes, which, however, was found after some time to be neglected.” The cry arose that the brave and gallant men, though enemies, were perishing with cold in prison; a subscription was set on foot; great sums were given by all ranks of people; and, notwithstanding the national foolish prejudices against the French, a remarkable zeal everywhere appeared for this charity. I am afraid that M. Rousseau could not have produced many parallel instances among his heroes, the Greeks; and still fewer among the Romans. Baretti, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journey from London to Genoa</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 62, 66), after telling how on all foreigners, even on a Turk wearing a turban, “the pretty appellation of <em>French dog</em> was liberally bestowed by the London rabble,” continues:⁠—“I have seen the populace of England contribute as many shillings as they could spare towards the maintenance of the French prisoners; and I have heard a universal shout of joy when their parliament voted £100,000 to the Portuguese on hearing of the tremendous earthquake.” <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1054" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

One thing,” Rogers continues, “ought to be remembered to his honour; an actress with whom he had lived bequeathed to him all her property, but he gave up every farthing of it to her relations.” He was pensioned in 1803, and he died in 1805.

					<p>Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 318) says that Johnson told him “that in his whole life he was never capable of discerning the least resemblance of any kind between a picture and the subject it was intended to represent.” This, however must have been an exaggeration on the part either of Hawkins or Johnson. His general ignorance of art is shown by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Anecdotes</i>, page 98):⁠—“Sir Joshua Reynolds mentioned some picture as excellent. ‘It has often grieved me, sir,’ said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson, ‘to see so much mind as the science of painting requires, laid out upon such perishable materials: why do not you oftener make use of copper? I could wish your superiority in the art you profess to be preserved in stuff more durable than canvas.’ Sir Joshua urged the difficulty of procuring a plate large enough for historical subjects. ‘What foppish obstacles are these!’ exclaims on a sudden <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson. ‘Here is Thrale has a thousand tun of copper; you may paint it all round if you will, I suppose; it will serve him to brew in afterwards. Will it not, Sir?’ to my husband who sat by. Indeed his utter scorn of painting was such, that I have heard him say, that he should sit very quietly in a room hung round with the works of the greatest masters, and never feel the slightest disposition to turn them, if their backs were outermost, unless it might be for the sake of telling Sir Joshua that he <em>had</em> turned them.” Such a remark of Johnson’s must not, however, be taken too strictly. He often spoke at random, often with exaggeration. “There is in many minds a kind of vanity exerted to the disadvantage of themselves.” This reflection of his is the opening sentence to the number of the Idler (<abbr>No.</abbr> 45) in which he thus writes about portrait-painting:⁠—“Genius is chiefly exerted in historical pictures; and the art of the painter of portraits is often lost in the obscurity of his subject. But it is in painting as in life; what is greatest is not always best. I should grieve to see Reynolds transfer to heroes and to goddesses, to empty splendour and to airy fiction, that art which is now employed in diffusing friendship, in reviving tenderness, in quickening the affections of the absent, and continuing the presence of the dead.” It is recorded in Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, (1787) <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 208, that “Johnson, talking with some persons about allegorical painting said, ‘I had rather see the portrait of a dog that I know than all the allegorical paintings they can show me in the world.’ ” He bought prints of Burke, Dyer, and Goldsmith⁠—“Good impressions’ he said to hang in a little room that he was fitting up with prints.

Savage, he says, was received into Lord Tyrconnel’s family and allowed a pension of £200 a year. “His presence,” Johnson writes, “was sufficient to make any place of public entertainment popular; and his approbation and example constituted the fashion. So powerful is genius when it is invested with the glitter of affluence!” In the last summer of his life, speaking of the chance of his pension being doubled, he said that with six hundred a year “a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the remainder of his life <em>in splendour</em>, how long soever it might be.” <i>Post</i>, June 30, 1784. David Hume writing in 1751, says:⁠—“I have £50 a year, a £100 worth of books, great store of linens and fine clothes, and near £100 in my pocket; along with order, frugality, a strong spirit of independency, good health, a contented humour, and an unabating love of study.

Goldsmith, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Present State of Polite Learning</i> (chap, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>), makes the following observation on pensions granted in France to authors:⁠—“The French nobility have certainly a most pleasing way of satisfying the vanity of an author without indulging his avarice. A man of literary merit is sure of being caressed by the great, though seldom enriched. His pension from the crown just supplies half a competence, and the sale of his labours makes some small addition to his circumstances; thus the author leads a life of splendid poverty, and seldom becomes wealthy or indolent enough to discontinue an exertion of those abilities by which he rose.” Whether Johnson’s pension led to his writing less than he would otherwise have done may be questioned. It is true that in the next seventeen years he did little more than finish his edition of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Shakespeare</i>, and write his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journey to the Western Islands</i> and two or three political pamphlets. But since he wrote the last number of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Idler</i> in the spring of 1760 he had done very little. His mind, which, to use Murphy’s words (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 80), had been “strained and overlaboured by constant exertion,” had not recovered its tone.

He desired me to undertake the task. I went to the chambers in the Inner Temple Lane, which, in fact, were the abode of wretchedness. By slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed. Johnson made a long pause; he asked if it was seriously intended. He fell into a profound meditation, and his own definition of a pensioner occurred to him. He desired to meet next day, and dine at the Mitre Tavern. At that meeting he gave up all his scruples. On the following day Lord Loughborough conducted him to the Earl of Bute. The conversation that passed was in the evening related to me by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson. He expressed his sense of his Majesty’s bounty, and thought himself the more highly honoured, as the favour was not bestowed on him for having dipped his pen in faction. ‘No, Sir,’ said Lord Bute, ‘it is not offered to you for having dipped your pen in faction, nor with a design that you ever should.’ ” The reviewer of Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i> in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Monthly Review</i>, lxxvi. 375, who was, no doubt, Murphy, adds a little circumstance:⁠—“On the next day <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murphy was in the Temple Lane soon after nine; <q>he got Johnson up and dressed in due time</q>; and saw him set off at eleven.” Malone’s note on what Lord Bute said to Johnson is as follows:⁠—“This was said by Lord Bute, as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney was informed by Johnson himself, in answer to a question which he put, previously to his acceptance of the intended bounty: ‘Pray, my Lord, what am I expected to do for this pension?’ ”<a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1110" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The Treasury, Home Office, Exchequer of Receipt and Audit Office Records have been searched for a warrant granting a pension to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson without success. In 1782, by Act of Parliament all pensions on the Civil List Establishment were from that time to be paid at the Exchequer. In the Exchequer Order Book, Michaelmas 1782, <abbr>No.</abbr> 46, page 74, the following memorandum occurs:⁠—‘Memdum. 3 <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1782. There was issued to the following persons (By order 6th of <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 1782) the sums set against their names respectively, <abbr>etc.</abbr>:⁠—Persons names: Johnson Saml, LL.D. Pensions page ann. £300. Due to 5 July 1782, two quarters, £150.’</p>
					<p>This pension was paid at the Exchequer from that time to the quarter ending 10 <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 1784. “It is clear that the pension was payable quarterly [for confirmation of this, see <i>post</i>, <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 3, 1762, and July 16, 1765] and at the old quarter days, July 5, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 10, <abbr>Jan.</abbr> 5, April 5, though payment was sometimes delayed. [Once he was paid half-yearly; see <i>post</i>, under March 20, 1771.] The expression ‘bills’ was a general term at the time for notes, cheques, and warrants, and no doubt covered some kind of Treasury warrant.” The above information I owe to the kindness of my friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Leonard H. Courtney, M.P., late Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The “future favours’ are the future payments. His pension was not for life, and depended therefore entirely on the king’s pleasure (see <i>post</i>, under March 21, 1775). The following letter in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Grenville Papers</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 68, seems to show that Johnson thought the pension due on the <em>new</em> quarter-day:⁠—</p>

					<p>A friend of mine once heard him, during this visit, exclaim with the utmost vehemence “I <em>hate</em> a Docker.” <cite>—Blakeway</cite>. Northcote (Life of Reynolds, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 118) says that Reynolds took Johnson to dine at a house where “he devoured so large a quantity of new honey and of clouted cream, besides drinking large potations of new cider, that the entertainer found himself much embarrassed between his anxious regard for the Doctor’s health and his fear of breaking through the rules of politeness, by giving him a hint on the subject. The strength of Johnson’s constitution, however, saved him from any unpleasant consequences.” “Sir Joshua informed a friend that he had never seen <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson intoxicated by hard drinking but once, and that happened at the time that they were together in Devonshire, when one night after supper Johnson drank three bottles of wine, which affected his speech so much that he was unable to articulate a hard word, which occurred in the course of his conversation. He attempted it three times but failed; yet at last accomplished it, and then said, ‘Well, Sir Joshua, I think it is now time to go to bed.’ ” <i>Ib</i>. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 161. One part of this story however is wanting in accuracy, and therefore all may be untrue. Reynolds at this time was not knighted.

(Edinburgh, Donaldson.) The Elegy is full of such errors as “Thou liv’d,” “Thou led,” but is recommended by a puffing preface and three letters⁠—one of which is signed J⁠—B. About the same time he brought out a piece that was even more impudent. It was <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">An Ode to Tragedy</i>. By a gentleman of Scotland. (Edinburgh, Donaldson, 1761. Price sixpence.) In the “Dedication to James Boswell, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>,” he says:⁠—“I have no intention to pay you compliments⁠—To entertain agreeable notions of one’s own character is a great incentive to act with propriety and spirit. But I should be sorry to contribute in any degree to your acquiring an excess of self-sufficiency⁠ ⁠… I own indeed that when⁠ ⁠… to display my extensive erudition, I have quoted Greek, Latin and French sentences one after another with astonishing celerity; or have got into my <em>Old-hock humour</em> and fallen a-raving about princes and lords, knights and geniuses, ladies of quality and harpsichords; you, with a peculiar comic smile, have gently reminded me of the <em>importance of a man to himself</em>, and slyly left the room with the witty Dean lying open at⁠—P.P. <em>clerk of this parish</em>.

					<p>“A soul by nature formed to feel Grief sharper than the tyrant’s steel, And bosom big with swelling thought From ancient lore’s remembrance brought.”</p>

					<p>My position has been very well illustrated by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belsham of Bedford, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essay on Dramatic Poetry</i>. “The fashionable doctrine (says he) both of moralists and critics in these times is, that virtue and happiness are constant concomitants; and it is regarded as a kind of dramatic impiety to maintain that virtue should not be rewarded, nor vice punished in the last scene of the last act of every tragedy. This conduct in our modern poets is, however, in my opinion, extremely injudicious; for, it labours in vain to inculcate a doctrine in theory, which everyone knows to be false in fact, <i><abbr>viz.</abbr></i> that virtue in real life is always productive of happiness; and vice of misery. Thus Congreve concludes the Tragedy of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Mourning Bride</i> with the following foolish couplet:⁠—</p>
					<p>“For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds,~~~And though a late, a sure reward succeeds.”</p>
					<p>“When a man eminently virtuous, a Brutus, a Cato, or a Socrates, finally sink under the pressure of accumulated misfortune, we are not only led to entertain a more indignant hatred of vice than if he rose from his distress, but we are inevitably induced to cherish the sublime idea that a day of future retribution will arrive when he shall receive not merely poetical, but real and substantial justice.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays Philosophical, Historical, and Literary</i>, London, 1791, volume <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 8vo. page 317.</p>
					<p>This is well reasoned and well expressed. I wish, indeed, that the ingenious author had not thought it necessary to introduce any <em>instance</em> of “a man eminently virtuous;” as he would then have avoided mentioning such a ruffian as Brutus under that description. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belsham discovers in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays</i> so much reading and thinking, and good composition, that I regret his not having been fortunate enough to be educated a member of our excellent national establishment.

Boswell’s “position has been illustrated” with far greater force by Johnson. “It has been the boast of some swelling moralists, that every man’s fortune was in his own power, that prudence supplied the place of all other divinities, and that happiness is the unfailing consequence of virtue. But surely the quiver of Omnipotence is stored with arrows against which the shield of human virtue, however adamantine it has been boasted, is held up in vain; we do not always suffer by our crimes; we are not always protected by our innocence.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Adventurer</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 120.

					<p>The account was as follows:⁠—“On the night of the 1st of February [1762] many gentlemen eminent for their rank and character were, by the invitation of the Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Aldrich, of Clerkenwell, assembled at his house, for the examination of the noises supposed to be made by a departed spirit, for the detection of some enormous crime.</p>
					<p>“About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl, supposed to be disturbed by a spirit, had, with proper caution, been put to bed by several ladies. They sat rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went downstairs, when they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied, in the strongest terms, any knowledge or belief of fraud.</p>
					<p>“The supposed spirit had before publicly promised, by an affirmative knock, that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the vault under the Church of <abbr>St.</abbr> John, Clerkenwell, where the body is deposited, and give a token of her presence there, by a knock upon her coffin; it was therefore determined to make this trial of the existence or veracity of the supposed spirit.</p>
					<p>“While they were enquiring and deliberating, they were summoned into the girl’s chamber by some ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, and was required to hold her hands out of bed. From that time, though the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression on the hand or body of any present, by scratches, knocks, or any other agency, no evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited.</p>
					<p>“The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom the promise was made of striking the coffin, was then about to visit the vault, and that the performance of the promise was then claimed. The company at one o’clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promise was made, went with another into the vault. The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than silence ensued: the person supposed to be accused by the spirit, then went down with several others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her. Between two and three she desired and was permitted to go home with her father.</p>

					<p>“⁠⸺⁠for shortness call’d Noll, Who wrote like an angel, and talk’d like poor Poll.”</p>
					<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds mentioned to me that he frequently heard Goldsmith talk warmly of the pleasure of being liked, and observe how hard it would be if literary excellence should preclude a man from that satisfaction, which he perceived it often did, from the envy which attended it; and therefore Sir Joshua was convinced that he was intentionally more absurd, in order to lessen himself in social intercourse, trusting that his character would be sufficiently supported by his works. If it indeed was his intention to appear absurd in company, he was often very successful.

					<p>All who are acquainted with the history of religion, (the most important, surely, that concerns the human mind,) know that the appellation of Methodists was first given to a society of students in the University of Oxford, who about the year 1730 were distinguished by an earnest and <em>methodical</em> attention to devout exercises. This disposition of mind is not a novelty, or peculiar to any sect, but has been, and still may be found, in many christians of every denomination. Johnson himself was, in a dignified manner, a Methodist. In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Rambler</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 110, he mentions with respect “the whole discipline of regulated piety;” and in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i>, many instances occur of his anxious examination into his spiritual state. That this religious earnestness, and in particular an observation of the influence of the Holy Spirit, has sometimes degenerated into folly, and sometimes been counterfeited for base purposes, cannot be denied. But it is not, therefore, fair to decry it when genuine. The principal argument in reason and good sense against methodism is, that it tends to debase human nature, and prevent the generous exertions of goodness, by an unworthy supposition that <b>God</b> will pay no regard to them; although it is positively said in the scriptures that He “will reward every man according to his works.” [<abbr>St.</abbr> Matthew <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> 27.] But I am happy to have it [in] my power to do justice to those whom it is the fashion to ridicule, without any knowledge of their tenets; and this I can do by quoting a passage from one of their best apologists, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Milner, who thus expresses their doctrine upon this subject. “Justified by faith, renewed in his faculties, and constrained by the love of Christ, their believer moves in the sphere of love and gratitude, and all his <em>duties</em> flow more or less from this principle. And though , yet love itself sweetens every duty to his mind; and he thinks there is no absurdity in his feeling the love of <b>God</b> as the grand commanding principle of his life.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essays on several religious Subjects</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, by Joseph Milner, A.M., Master of the Grammar School of Kingston upon-Hull, 1789, p. 11. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Southey (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Wesley</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 41), mentioning the names given at Oxford to Wesley and his followers, continues:⁠—“One person with less irreverence and more learning observed, in reference to their methodical manner of life, that a new sect of Methodists was sprung up, alluding to the ancient school of physicians known by that name.” Wesley, in 1744, wrote <i epub:type="se:name.publication.essay">The Humble Address to the King of the Societies in derision called Methodists</i>. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 437. He often speaks of “the people called Methodists,” but sometimes he uses the term without any qualification. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale, in 1780, wrote to Johnson:⁠—“Methodist is considered always a term of reproach, I trust, because I never yet did hear that any one person called himself a Methodist.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 119. <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1349" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker, misunderstanding a passage in Hawkins, writes:⁠—“Hawkins says that he disliked to be called Doctor, as reminding him that he had been a schoolmaster.” What Hawkins really says (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 446) is this:⁠—“His attachment to Oxford prevented Johnson from receiving this honour as it was intended, and he never assumed the title which it conferred. He was as little pleased to be called Doctor in consequence of it, as he was with the title of <em>Domine</em>, which a friend of his once incautiously addressed him by. He thought it alluded to his having been a schoolmaster.” It is clear that “it” in the last line refers only to the title of <em>Domine</em>. Murphy (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 98) says that Johnson never assumed the title of Doctor, till Oxford conferred on him the degree. Boswell states (<i>post</i>, March 31, 1775, note):⁠—“It is remarkable that he never, so far as I know, assumed his title of <em>Doctor</em>, but called himself <em><abbr>Mr.</abbr></em> Johnson.” In this, as I show there, Boswell seems to be not perfectly accurate. I do not believe Hawkins’s assertion that Johnson “was little pleased to be called Doctor in consequence of his Dublin degree.” In Boswell’s Hebrides, most of which was read by him before he received his Oxford degree, he is commonly styled Doctor. Boswell says in a note on <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 15, 1773:⁠—“It was some time before I could bring myself to call him Doctor.” Had Johnson disliked the title it would have been known to Boswell. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale, it is true, in her letters’ to him, after he had received both his degrees, commonly speaks of him as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson. We may assume that he valued his Oxford degree of M.A. more highly than the Dublin degree of LL.D.; for in the third edition of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Abridgment of his Dictionary</i>, published in 1766, he is styled Samuel Johnson, A.M. In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Poets</i> he calls himself simply Samuel Johnson. He had by that time risen above degrees. In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journey to the Hebrides</i> (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 14), after stating that “An English or Irish doctorate cannot be obtained by a very young man,” he continues:⁠—“It is reasonable to suppose⁠ ⁠… that he who is by age qualified to be a doctor, has in so much time gained learning sufficient not to disgrace the title, or wit sufficient not to desire it.” <a href="part-1.xhtml#noteref-1429" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Johnson had joined Voltaire with Dennis and Rymer. “Dennis and Rymer think Shakespeare’s Romans not sufficiently Roman; and Voltaire censures his kings as not completely royal. Dennis is offended that Menenius, a senator of Rome, should play the buffoon; and Voltaire, perhaps, thinks decency violated when the Danish usurper is represented as a drunkard. But Shakespeare always makes nature predominate over accident.⁠ ⁠… His story requires Romans or kings, but he thinks only on men. He knew that Rome, like every other city, had men of all dispositions; and wanting a buffoon, he went into the senate-house for that which the senate-house would certainly have afforded him. He was inclined to show an usurper and a murderer, not only odious, but despicable; he therefore added drunkenness to his other qualities, knowing that kings love wine like other men, and that wine exerts its natural power upon kings.

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton did not disregard this counsel, but wrote the following account, which he has been pleased to communicate to me:</p>
					<p>“The circumstances of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Peregrine Langton were these. He had an annuity for life of two hundred pounds per annum. He resided in a village in Lincolnshire; the rent of his house, with two or three small fields, was twenty-eight pounds; the county he lived in was not more than moderately cheap; his family consisted of a sister, who paid him eighteen pounds annually for her board, and a niece. The servants were two maids, and two men in livery. His common way of living, at his table, was three or four dishes; the appurtenances to his table were neat and handsome; he frequently entertained company at dinner, and then his table was well served with as many dishes as were usual at the tables of the other gentlemen in the neighbourhood. His own appearance, as to clothes, was genteelly neat and plain. He had always a post-chaise, and kept three horses.</p>
					<p>“Such, with the resources I have mentioned, was his way of living, which he did not suffer to employ his whole income: for he had always a sum of money lying by him for any extraordinary expenses that might arise. Some money he put into the stocks; at his death, the sum he had there amounted to one hundred and fifty pounds. He purchased out of his income his household-furniture and linen, of which latter he had a very ample store; and, as I am assured by those that had very good means of knowing, not less than the tenth part of his income was set apart for charity: at the time of his death, the sum of twenty-five pounds was found, with a direction to be employed in such uses.</p>
					<p>“He had laid down a plan of living proportioned to his income, and did not practise any extraordinary degree of parsimony, but endeavoured that in his family there should be plenty without waste; as an instance that this was his endeavour, it may be worth while to mention a method he took in regulating a proper allowance of malt liquor to be drunk in his family, that there might not be a deficiency, or any intemperate profusion: On a complaint made that his allowance of a hogshead in a month, was not enough for his own family, he ordered the quantity of a hogshead to be put into bottles, had it locked up from the servants, and distributed out, every day, eight quarts, which is the quantity each day at one hogshead in a month; and told his servants, that if that did not suffice, he would allow them more; but, by this method, it appeared at once that the allowance was much more than sufficient for his small family; and this proved a clear conviction, that could not be answered, and saved all future dispute. He was, in general, very diligently and punctually attended and obeyed by his servants; he was very considerate as to the injunctions he gave, and explained them distinctly; and, at their first coming to his service, steadily exacted a close compliance with them, without any remission; and the servants finding this to be the case, soon grew habitually accustomed to the practice of their business, and then very little further attention was necessary. On extraordinary instances of good behaviour, or diligent service, he was not wanting in particular encouragements and presents above their wages; it is remarkable that he would permit their relations to visit them, and stay at his house two or three days at a time.</p>
					<p>“The wonder, with most that hear an account of his economy, will be, how he was able, with such an income, to do so much, especially when it is considered that he paid for everything he had; he had no land, except the two or three small fields which I have said he rented; and, instead of gaining anything by their produce, I have reason to think he lost by them; however, they furnished him with no further assistance towards his housekeeping, than grass for his horses, (not hay, for that I know he bought,) and for two cows. Every Monday morning he settled his family accounts, and so kept up a constant attention to the confining his expenses within his income; and to do it more exactly, compared those expenses with a computation he had made, how much that income would afford him every week and day of the year. One of his oeconomical practices was, as soon as any repair was wanting in or about his house, to have it immediately performed. When he had money to spare, he chose to lay in a provision of linen or clothes, or any other necessaries; as then, he said, he could afford it, which he might not be so well able to do when the actual want came; in consequence of which method, he had a considerable supply of necessary articles lying by him, beside what was in use.</p>
					<p>“But the main particular that seems to have enabled him to do so much with his income, was, that he paid for everything as soon as he had it, except, alone, what were current accounts, such as rent for his house and servants’ wages; and these he paid at the stated times with the utmost exactness. He gave notice to the tradesmen of the neighbouring market-towns that they should no longer have his custom, if they let any of his servants have anything without their paying for it. Thus he put it out of his power to commit those imprudences to which those are liable that defer their payments by using their money some other way than where it ought to go. And whatever money he had by him, he knew that it was not demanded elsewhere, but that he might safely employ it as he pleased.</p>
					<p>“His example was confined, by the sequestered place of his abode, to the observation of few, though his prudence and virtue would have made it valuable to all who could have known it.⁠—These few particulars, which I knew myself, or have obtained from those who lived with him, may afford instruction, and be an incentive to that wise art of living, which he so successfully practised.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1523" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

To all these gentlemen I beg leave to make my grateful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was pleased to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, then one of his Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal pleasure concerning it by a letter, in these words: “I have the King’s commands to assure you, Sir, how sensible his Majesty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the conversation previous to its publication.

					<p>The <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Strahan clearly recollects having been told by Johnson, that the King observed that Pope made Warburton a Bishop. “True, Sir, (said Johnson,) but Warburton did more for Pope; he made him a Christian:” alluding, no doubt, to his ingenious Comments on the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essay on Man</i>. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. The statements both of the King and Johnson are supported by two passages in Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Pope</i>, (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 289, 290). He says of Warburton’s Comments:⁠—“Pope, who probably began to doubt the tendency of his own work, was glad that the positions, of which he perceived himself not to know the full meaning, could by any mode of interpretation be made to mean well.⁠ ⁠… From this time Pope lived in the closest intimacy with his commentator, and amply rewarded his kindness and his zeal; for he introduced him to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murray, by whose interest he became preacher at Lincoln’s Inn; and to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Allen, who gave him his niece and his estate, and by consequence a bishopric.” See also the account given by Johnson, in Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 21, 1773. Bishop Law in his Revised Preface to Archbishop King’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Origin of Evil</i> (1781), page <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xvii</span>, writes:⁠—“I had now the satisfaction of seeing that those very principles which had been maintained by Archbishop King were adopted by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pope in his Essay on Man; this I used to recollect, and sometimes relate, with pleasure, conceiving that such an account did no less honour to the poet than to our philosopher; but was soon made to understand that anything of that kind was taken highly amiss by one [Warburton] who had once held the doctrine of that same Essay to be rank atheism, but afterwards turned a warm advocate for it, and thought proper to deny the account above-mentioned, with heavy menaces against those who presumed to insinuate that Pope borrowed anything from any man whatsoever.” See <i>post</i>, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 10, 1779. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1569" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In the Preface to my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Account of Corsica</i>, published in 1768, I thus express myself:</p>
					<p>“He who publishes a book affecting not to be an author, and professing an indifference for literary fame, may possibly impose upon many people such an idea of his consequence as he wishes may be received. For my part, I should be proud to be known as an author, and I have an ardent ambition for literary fame; for, of all possessions, I should imagine literary fame to be the most valuable. A man who has been able to furnish a book, which has been approved by the world, has established himself as a respectable character in distant society, without any danger of having that character lessened by the observation of his weaknesses. To preserve an uniform dignity among those who see us every day, is hardly possible; and to aim at it, must put us under the fetters of perpetual restraint. The author of an approved book may allow his natural disposition an easy play, and yet indulge the pride of superior genius, when he considers that by those who know him only as an author, he never ceases to be respected. Such an author, when in his hours of gloom and discontent, may have the consolation to think, that his writings are, at that very time, giving pleasure to numbers; and such an author may cherish the hope of being remembered after death, which has been a great object to the noblest minds in all ages.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. His preface to the third edition thus ends:⁠—“When I first ventured to send this book into the world, I fairly owned an ardent desire for literary fame. I have obtained my desire: and whatever clouds may overcast my days, I can now walk here among the rocks and woods of my ancestors, with an agreeable consciousness that I have done something worthy.” The dedication of the first edition and the preface of the third are both dated <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 29⁠—one 1767, and the other 1768. <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 29 was his birthday. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1674" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Paoli’s father had been one of the leaders of the Corsicans in their revolt against Genoa in 1734. Paoli himself was chosen by them as their General-in-chief in 1755. In 1769 the island was conquered by the French. He escaped in an English ship, and settled in England. Here he stayed till 1789, when Mirabeau moved in the National Assembly the recall of all the Corsican patriots. Paoli was thereupon appointed by Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span>. Lieutenant-general and military commandant in Corsica. He resisted the violence of the Convention, and was, in consequence, summoned before it. Refusing to obey, an expedition was sent to arrest him. Napoleon Bonaparte fought in the French army, but Paoli’s party proved the stronger. The islanders sought the aid of Great Britain, and offered the crown of Corsica to George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. The offer was accepted, but by an act of incredible folly, not Paoli, but Sir Gilbert Eliot, was made Viceroy. Paoli returned to England, where he died in 1807, at the age of eighty-two. In 1796 Corsica was abandoned by the English. By the Revolution it ceased to be a conquered province, having been formally declared an integral part of France. At the present day the Corsicans are proud of being citizens of that great country; no less proud, however, are they of Pascal Paoli, and of the gallant struggle for independence of their forefathers. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1675" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Ignorant, indeed, is he who thinks that Johnson was insensible to Shakespeare’s “transcendent and unbounded genius,” to use the words that he himself applied to him. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Rambler</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 156. “It may be doubtful,” he writes, “whether from all his successors more maxims of theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence, can be collected than he alone has given to his country.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 131. “He that has read Shakespeare with attention will, perhaps, find little new in the crowded world.” <i>Ib</i>, page 434. “Let him that is yet unacquainted with the powers of Shakespeare, and who desires to feel the highest pleasure that the drama can give, read every play, from the first scene to the last, with utter negligence of all his commentators. When his fancy is once on the wing, let it not stoop at correction or explanation.” <i>Ib</i>, page 152. And lastly he quotes Dryden’s words [from Dryden’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essay of Dramatick Poesie</i>, edit. of 1701, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 19] “that Shakespeare was the man who, of all modern and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul.” <i>Ib</i>, page 153. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi records (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Anecdotes</i>, page 58), that she “forced Johnson one day in a similar humour [to that in which he had praised Congreve] to prefer Young’s description of night to those of Shakespeare and Dryden.” He ended however by saying:⁠—“Young froths and foams and bubbles sometimes very vigorously; but we must not compare the noise made by your teakettle here with the roaring of the ocean.” See also <a href="part-2.xhtml#II-page-96">here</a>. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1725" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Of whom I acknowledge myself to be one, considering it as a piece of the secondary or comparative species of criticism; and not of that profound species which alone <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson would allow to be ‘real criticism.’ It is, besides, clearly and elegantly expressed, and has done effectually what it professed to do, namely, vindicated Shakespeare from the misrepresentations of Voltaire; and considering how many young people were misled by his witty, though false observations, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu’s Essay was of service to Shakespeare with a certain class of readers, and is, therefore, entitled to praise. Johnson, I am assured, allowed the merit which I have stated, saying, (with reference to Voltaire,) ‘it is conclusive <i xml:lang="la">ad hominem</i>.’ ” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. That this dull essay, which would not do credit to a clever schoolgirl of seventeen, should have had a fame, of which the echoes have not yet quite died out, can only be fully explained by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu’s great wealth and position in society. Contemptible as was her essay, yet a saying of hers about Voltaire was clever. “He sent to the Academy an invective [against Shakespeare] that bears all the marks of passionate dotage. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu happened to be present when it was read. Suard, one of their writers, said to her, ‘Je crois, Madame, que vous êtes un peu fâché (sic) de ce que vous venez d’entendre.’ She replied, ‘Moi, Monsieur! point du tout! Je ne suis pas amie de M. Voltaire.’ ” Walpole’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 394. Her own <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i> are very pompous and very poor, and her wit would not seem to have flashed often; for Miss Burney wrote of her:⁠—“She reasons well, and harangues well, but wit she has none.” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 335. Yet in this same <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 112) we find evidence of the absurdly high estimate that was commonly formed of her. “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale asked me if I did not want to see <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu. I truly said, I should be the most insensible of all animals not to like to see our sex’s glory.” That she was a very extraordinary woman we have Johnson’s word for it. (See <i>post</i>, May 15, 1784.) It is impossible, however, to discover anything that rises above commonplace in anything that she wrote, and, so far as I know, that she said, with the exception of her one saying about Voltaire. Johnson himself, in one of his letters to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale, has a laugh at her. He had mentioned Shakespeare, nature and friendship, and continues:⁠—“Now, of whom shall I proceed to speak? Of whom but <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu? Having mentioned Shakespeare and Nature, does not the name of Montagu force itself upon me? Such were the transitions of the ancients, which now seem abrupt, because the intermediate idea is lost to modern understandings.

Therefore it is that I feel an irresistible impulse to be present at every execution, as I there behold the various effects of the near approach of death.” He maintains “that the curiosity which impels people to be present at such affecting scenes, is certainly a proof of sensibility, not of callousness.

					<p>“He had been assailed in the grossest manner possible by a woman of the town, and, driving her off with a blow, was set upon by three bullies. He thereupon ran away in great fear, for he was a timid man, and being pursued, had stabbed two of the men with a small knife he carried in his pocket.” Garrick and Beauclerk testified that everyone abroad carried such a knife, for in foreign inns only forks were provided. “When you travel abroad do you carry such knives as this?” Garrick was asked. “Yes,” he answered, “or we should have no victuals.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson: His Friends and His Critics</i>, page 288. I have extracted from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sessional Reports</i> for 1769, page 431, the following evidence as to Baretti’s character:⁠—“<b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Sir Joshua Reynolds</b>. I have known <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Baretti fifteen or sixteen years. He is a man of great humanity, and very active in endeavouring to help his friends. He is a gentleman of a good temper; I never knew him quarrelsome in my life; he is of a sober disposition.⁠ ⁠… This affair was on a club night of the Royal Academicians. We expected him there, and were inquiring about him before we heard of this accident. He is secretary for foreign correspondence.” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Johnson</b>. I believe I began to be acquainted with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Baretti about the year ’53 or ’54. I have been intimate with him. He is a man of literature, a very studious man, a man of great diligence. He gets his living by study. I have no reason to think he was ever disordered with liquor in his life. A man that I never knew to be otherwise than peaceable, and a man that I take to be rather timorous.” Qu. “Was he addicted to pick up women in the street?” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> J. I never knew that he was.” Qu. “How is he as to his eyesight?” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> J. He does not see me now, nor I do not [sic] see him. I do not believe he could be capable of assaulting anybody in the street without great provocation.” “<b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Edmund Burke</b> <abbr>Esq.</abbr> I have known him between three and four years; he is an ingenious man, a man of remarkable humanity⁠—a thorough good-natured man.” “<b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">David Garrick <abbr>Esq.</abbr></b> I never knew a man of a more active benevolence.⁠ ⁠… He is a man of great probity and morals.” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Goldsmith</b>. I have had the honour of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Baretti’s company at my chambers in the Temple. He is a most humane, benevolent, peaceable man.⁠ ⁠… He is a man of as great humanity as any in the world.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fitzherbert and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hallifax also gave evidence. “There were diverse other gentlemen in court to speak for his character, but the Court thought it needless to call them.” It is curious that Boswell passes over Reynolds and Goldsmith among the witnesses. Baretti’s bail before Lord Mansfield were Burke, Garrick, Reynolds, and Fitzherbert. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi tells the following anecdotes of Baretti:⁠—“When Johnson and Burke went to see him in Newgate, they had small comfort to give him, and bid him not hope too strongly. ‘Why, what can <em>he</em> fear,’ says Baretti, placing himself between them, ‘that holds two such hands as I do?’ An Italian came one day to Baretti, when he was in Newgate, to desire a letter of recommendation for the teaching his scholars, when he (Baretti) should be hanged. ‘You rascal,’ replies Baretti in a rage, ‘if I were not <em>in my own apartment</em>, I would kick you downstairs directly.’ ” Hayward’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piazzi</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 348. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> T.

He had one virtue which I hold one of the most difficult to practise. After the heat of contest was over, if he had been informed that his antagonist resented his rudeness, he was the first to seek after a reconciliation.⁠ ⁠… That he was not thus strenuous for victory with his intimates in tête-à-tête conversations when there were no witnesses, may be easily believed.

					<p>“To James Boswell, <abbr>Esq.</abbr><!-- recipient --></p>
					<p>“<i>Edinburgh</i>, May 3, 1792.</p>
					<p>“MY Dear Sir<!-- salutation -->,</p>
					<p>“As I suppose your great work will soon be reprinted, I beg leave to trouble you with a remark on a passage of it, in which I am a little misrepresented. Be not alarmed; the misrepresentation is not imputable to you. Not having the book at hand, I cannot specify the page, but I suppose you will easily find it. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson says, speaking of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale’s family, ‘<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beattie <q>sunk upon us</q> that he was married, or words to that purpose.’ I am not sure that I understand <q>sunk upon us</q>, which is a very uncommon phrase, but it seems to me to imply, (and others, I find, have understood it in the same sense,) <q>studiously concealed from us his being married</q>. Now, Sir, this was by no means the case. I could have no motive to conceal a circumstance, of which I never was nor can be ashamed; and of which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson seemed to think, when he afterwards became acquainted with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beattie, that I had, as was true, reason to be proud. So far was I from concealing her, that my wife had at that time almost as numerous an acquaintance in London as I had myself; and was, not very long after, kindly invited and elegantly entertained at Streatham by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale.</p>
					<p>“My request, therefore, is, that you would rectify this matter in your new edition. You are at liberty to make what use you please of this letter.</p>
					<p>“My best wishes ever attend you and your family. Believe me to be, with the utmost regard and esteem, dear Sir,</p>
					<p>“Your obliged and affectionate humble servant, J. <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Beattie</b><!-- signature -->.”</p>
					<p>I have, from my respect for my friend <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beattie, and regard to his extreme sensibility, inserted the foregoing letter, though I cannot but wonder at his considering as any imputation a phrase commonly used among the best friends. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker says there was a cause for the “extreme sensibility.” “<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Beattie was conscious that there was something that might give a colour to such an imputation. It became known, shortly after the date of this letter, that the mind of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Beattie had become deranged.” Beattie would have found in Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dictionary</i> an explanation of <q>sunk upon us</q>⁠—‘<q>To sink. To suppress; to conceal</q>.’ ‘If sent with ready money to buy anything, and you happen to be out of pocket, <em>sink</em> the money and take up the goods on account.’ ” Swift’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rules to Servants</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 256. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1902" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He was prosecuted for publishing a book against the doctrines of the Trinity, but was discharged, being, he writes, treated by the Judge with great humanity. In his pamphlet he says (page 49):⁠—“You see what I have already done in my former book. I have challenged the greatest potentates on earth, yea, even the King of Great Britain, whose true and faithful subject I am in all temporal things, and whom I love and honour; also his noble and valiant friend, John Argyle, and his great friends Robert Walpole, Charles Wager, and Arthur Onslow; all these can speak well, and who is like them; and yet, behold, none of all these cared to engage with their friend Elwall.” See <i>post</i>, May 7, 1773. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Priestley had received an account of the trial from a gentleman who was present, who described Elwall as “a tall man, with white hair, a large beard and flowing garments, who struck everybody with respect. He spoke about an hour with great gravity, fluency, and presence of mind.” The trial took place, he said, in 1726. “It is impossible,” adds Priestley (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1831, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 417), “for an unprejudiced person to read Elwall’s account of his trial, without feeling the greatest veneration for the writer.” In truth, Elwall spoke with all the simple power of the best of the early Quakers. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-1953" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“May 27, 1773. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Goldsmith has written a comedy⁠—no, it is the lowest of all farces. It is not the subject I condemn, though very vulgar, but the execution.

The situations, however, are well imagined, and make one laugh, in spite of the grossness of the dialogue, the forced witticisms, and total improbability of the whole plan and conduct. But what disgusts me most is, that though the characters are very low, and aim at low humour, not one of them says a sentence that is natural or marks any character at all.

Sir Robert was gathering snails, and throwing them over the wall into his neighbours garden. The Doctor repreached him very roughly, and stated to him that this was unmannerly and unneighbourly. ‘Sir,’ said Sir Robert, ‘my neighbour is a Dissenter.’ ‘Oh!’ said the Doctor, ‘if so, Chambers, toss away, toss away, as hard as you can.’ He was very absent. I have seen him standing for a very long time, without moving, with a foot on each side the kennel which was then in the middle of the High Street, with his eyes fixed on the water running in it. In the common-room of University College he was dilating upon some subject, and the then head of Lincoln College, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer, occasionally interrupted him, saying, ‘I deny that.’ This was often repeated, and observed upon by Johnson, in terms expressive of increasing displeasure and anger. At length upon the Doctor’s repeating the words, ‘I deny that,’ ‘Sir, Sir,’ said Johnson, ‘you must have forgot that an author has said: <i xml:lang="la">Plus negabit tinus asinus in una hora quam centum philosophi probaverint in centum annis</i>.’ ” [<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Fisher, who related this story to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker, described <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Mortimer as “a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mortimer, a shallow underbred man, who had no sense of Johnson’s superiority.

					<p>A passage in the <i>North Briton</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 34, shows how widespread this prejudice was.

					<p>Even David Hume subscribed to the fund.

Adam Smith told me that the Piper of the Argyleshire militia repeated to him all those which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macpherson had translated.

Men run with great avidity to give their evidence in favour of what flatters their passions and their national prejudices.

					<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> T.

					<p>This was not merely a cursory remark; for in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Fenton</i> he observes, “With many other wise and virtuous men, who at that time of discord and debate (about the beginning of this century) consulted conscience [whether] well or ill informed, more than interest, he doubted the legality of the government; and refusing to qualify himself for public employment, by taking the oaths [by the oaths] required, left the University without a degree.” This conduct Johnson calls “perverseness of integrity.” [Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 54.</p>
					<p>The question concerning the morality of taking oaths, of whatever kind, imposed by the prevailing power at the time, rather than to be excluded from all consequence, or even any considerable usefulness in society, has been agitated with all the acuteness of casuistry. It is related, that he who devised the oath of abjuration, profligately boasted, that he had framed a test which should “damn one half of the nation, and starve the other.” Upon minds not exalted to inflexible rectitude, or minds in which zeal for a party is predominant to excess, taking that oath against conviction may have been palliated under the plea of necessity, or ventured upon in heat, as upon the whole producing more good than evil.</p>
					<p>At a county election in Scotland, many years ago, when there was a warm contest between the friends of the Hanoverian succession, and those against it, the oath of abjuration having been demanded, the freeholders upon one side rose to go away.

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> S.

The <abbr>MS.</abbr>, the editor says, was discovered behind an old press in one of the offices of his Court. The name of the writer nowhere appears in the <abbr>MS.</abbr> It is clear, however, that if it is not a forgery, the author was Campbell. In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Edinburgh Review</i> for <abbr>Oct.</abbr>, 1859, its authenticity is examined, and is declared to be beyond a doubt. Lord Macaulay aided the Reviewer in his investigation. <i>Ib</i> page 323. He could scarcely, however, have come to his task with a mind altogether free from bias, for the editor “has contrived,” we are told, “to expose another of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker’s blunders.” Faith in him cannot be wrong who proves that Croker is not in the right. The value of this <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i> is rated too highly by the Reviewer. The Master of Balliol College has pointed out to me that it adds but very little to Johnson’s sayings. So far as he is concerned, we are told scarcely anything of mark that we did not know already. This makes the Master doubt its genuineness. I have noticed one suspicious passage. An account is given of a dinner at <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale’s on April 1, at which Campbell met Murphy, Boswell, and Baretti. “Johnson’s bons mots were retailed in such plenty that they, like a surfeit, could not lie upon my memory.” In one of the stories told by Murphy, Johnson is made to say, “Damn the rascal.” Murphy would as soon have made the Archbishop of Canterbury swear as Johnson; much sooner the Archbishop of York. It was Murphy “who paid him the highest compliment that ever was paid to a layman, by asking his pardon for repeating some oaths in the course of telling a story” (<i>post</i>, April 12, 1776). Even supposing that at this time he was ignorant of his character, though the supposition is a wild one, he would at once have been set right by Boswell and the Thrales (<i>post</i>, under March 15, 1776). It is curious, that this anecdote imputing profanity to Johnson is not quoted by the Edinburgh reviewer. On the whole I think that the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i> is genuine, and accordingly I have quoted it more than once. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-2464" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

My father, whom I really both respect and affectionate (if that is a word, for it is a different feeling from that which is expressed by <em>love</em>, which I can say of you from my soul), is so different from me. We <em>divaricate</em> so much, as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson said, that I am often hurt when, I dare say, he means no harm: and he has a method of treating me which makes me feel myself like a <em>timid boy</em>, which to <em>Boswell</em> (comprehending all that my character does in my own imagination and in that of a wonderful number of mankind) is intolerable. His wife too, whom in my conscience I cannot condemn for any capital bad quality, is so narrow-minded, and, I don’t know how, so set upon keeping him under her own management, and so suspicious and so sourishly tempered that it requires the utmost exertion of practical philosophy to keep myself quiet.

					<p>According to <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay he said:⁠—“Sir, I shall be very glad to have a new sense <em>put into</em> me.” He had been wont to speak slightingly of music and musicians. “The first symptom that he showed of a tendency to conversion was upon hearing the following read aloud from the preface to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Music</i> while it was yet in manuscript:⁠—‘The love of lengthened tones and modulated sounds seems a passion implanted in human nature throughout the globe; as we hear of no people, however wild and savage in other particulars, who have not music of some kind or other, with which they seem greatly delighted.’ ‘Sir,’ cried <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson after a little pause, ‘this assertion I believe may be right.’ And then, seesawing a minute or two on his chair, he forcibly added:⁠—‘All animated nature loves music⁠—except myself!’ ” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney’s Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 77. Hawkins (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 319) says that Johnson said of music, “ ‘it excites in my mind no ideas, and hinders me from contemplating my own.’ I have sometimes thought that music was positive pain to him. Upon his hearing a celebrated performer go through a hard composition, and hearing it remarked that it was very difficult, he said, ‘I would it had been impossible.’ ” Yet he had once bought a flageolet, though he had never made out a tune. “Had I learnt to fiddle,” he said, “I should have done nothing else” (<i>post</i>, April 7, 1778, and Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 15, 1773). Not six months before his death he asked <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney to teach him the scale of music (<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2237">this note</a>). That “he appeared fond of the bagpipe, and used often to stand for some time with his ear close to the great drone” (Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 15), does not tell for much either way. In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i> (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 55), he shows his pleasure in singing. “After supper,” he writes, “the ladies sung Erse songs, to which I listened, as an English audience to an Italian opera, delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.” Boswell records (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 28) that another day a lady “pleased him much, by singing Erse songs, and playing on the guitar.” Johnson himself shows that if his ear was dull to music, it was by no means dead to sound. He thus describes a journey by night in the Highlands (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 155):⁠—“The wind was loud, the rain was heavy, and the whistling of the blast, the fall of the shower, the rush of the cataracts, and the roar of the torrent, made a nobler chorus of the rough music of nature than it had ever been my chance to hear before.” In 1783, when he was in his seventy-fourth year, he said, on hearing the music of a funeral procession:⁠—“This is the first time that I have ever been affected by musical sounds.” <i>Post</i>, 1780, in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Collection</i>. <a href="part-2.xhtml#noteref-2696" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>As first, the opinion of some distinguished naturalists, that our species is transmitted through males only, the female being all along no more than a nidus, or nurse, as Mother Earth is to plants of every sort; which notion seems to be confirmed by that text of scripture, “He was yet <q>in the loins of his <b>father</b></q> when Melchisedeck met him” (Heb. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 10); and consequently, that a man’s grandson by a daughter, instead of being his <em>surest</em> descendant as is vulgarly said, has in reality no connection whatever with his blood. And secondly, independent of this theory, (which, if true, should completely exclude heirs general,) that if the preference of a male to a female, without regard to primogeniture, (as a son, though much younger, nay, even a grandson by a son, to a daughter,) be once admitted, as it universally is, it must be equally reasonable and proper in the most remote degree of descent from an original proprietor of an estate, as in the nearest; because⁠—however distant from the representative at the time⁠—that remote heir male, upon the failure of those nearer to the <em>original proprietor</em> than he is, becomes in fact the nearest male to <em>him</em>, and is, therefore, preferable as <em>his</em> representative, to a female descendant.⁠—A little extension of mind will enable us easily to perceive that a son’s son, in continuation to whatever length of time, is preferable to a son’s daughter, in the succession to an ancient inheritance; in which regard should be had to the representation of the original proprietor, and not to that of one of his descendants.</p>

Gibbon tells us in his memoirs [<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Misc.</abbr> Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 56] that at Oxford he took a fancy for studying Arabic, and was prevented from doing so by the remonstrances of his tutor. Soon after this, the young man fell in with Bossuet’s controversial writings, and was speedily converted by them to the Roman Catholic faith. The apostasy of a gentleman-commoner would of course be for a time the chief subject of conversation in the common room of Magdalene. His whim about Arabic learning would naturally be mentioned, and would give occasion to some jokes about the probability of his turning Mussulman. If such jokes were made, Johnson, who frequently visited Oxford, was very likely to hear of them.” Though Gibbon’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Autobiography</i> ends with the year 1788, yet he wrote portions of it, I believe, after the publication of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Johnson</i>.

					<p>Such is this little laughable incident, which has been often related. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Percy, the Bishop of Dromore, who was an intimate friend of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Grainger, and has a particular regard for his memory, has communicated to me the following explanation:⁠—</p>
					<p>“The passage in question was originally not liable to such a perversion; for the author having occasion in that part of his work to mention the havock made by rats and mice, had introduced the subject in a kind of mock heroic, and a parody of Homer’s battle of the frogs and mice, invoking the Muse of the old Grecian bard in an elegant and well-turned manner. In that state I had seen it; but afterwards, unknown to me and other friends, he had been persuaded, contrary to his own better judgement, to alter it, so as to produce the unlucky effect above-mentioned.”</p>
					<p>The above was written by the Bishop when he had not the Poem itself to recur to; and though the account given was true of it at one period, yet as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Grainger afterwards altered the passage in question, the remarks in the text do not now apply to the printed poem.</p>

					<p>What <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson has here said, is undoubtedly good sense; yet I am afraid that law, though defined by Lord Coke “the perfection of reason,” is not altogether <em>with him</em>; for it is held in the books, that an attack on the reputation even of a dead man, may be punished as a libel, because tending to a breach of the peace. There is, however, I believe, no modern decided case to that effect. In the King’s Bench, Trinity Term, 1790, the question occurred on occasion of an indictment, <i epub:type="se:name.legal-case">The King <abbr>v.</abbr> Topham</i>, who, as a <em>proprietor</em> of a newspaper entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The World</i>, was found guilty of a libel against Earl Cowper, deceased, because certain injurious charges against his Lordship were published in that paper. An arrest of Judgment having been moved for, the case was afterwards solemnly argued. My friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Const, whom I delight in having an opportunity to praise, not only for his abilities but his manners; a gentleman whose ancient German blood has been mellowed in England, and who may be truely said to unite the <em>Baron</em> and the <em>Barrister</em>, was one of the Counsel for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Topham. He displayed much learning and ingenuity upon the general question; which, however, was not decided, as the Court granted an arrest chiefly on the informality of the indictment. No man has a higher reverence for the law of England than I have; but, with all deference I cannot help thinking, that prosecution by indictment, if a defendant is never to be allowed to justify, must often be very oppressive, unless Juries, whom I am more and more confirmed in holding to be judges of law as well as of fact, resolutely interpose. Of late an act of Parliament has passed declaratory of their full right to one as well as the other, in matter of libel; and the bill having been brought in by a popular gentleman, many of his party have in most extravagant terms declaimed on the wonderful acquisition to the liberty of the press. For my own part I ever was clearly of opinion that this right was inherent in the very constitution of a Jury, and indeed in sense and reason inseparable from their important function. To establish it, therefore, by Statute, is, I think, narrowing its foundation, which is the broad and deep basis of Common Law. Would it not rather weaken the right of primogeniture, or any other old and universally-acknowledged right, should the legislature pass an act in favour of it? In my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.pamphlet">Letter to the People of Scotland, against diminishing the number of the Lords of Session</i>, published in 1785, there is the following passage, which, as a concise, and I hope a fair and rational state of the matter, I presume to quote: “The Juries of England are Judges of <em>law</em> as well as of fact, in <em>many civil</em>, and in all <em>criminals</em> trials. That my principles of <em>resistance</em> may not be misapprehended and more than my principles of <em>submission</em>, I protest that I should be the last man in the world to encourage Juries to contradict rashly, wantonly, or perversely, the opinion of the Judges. On the contrary, I would have them listen respectfully to the advise they receive from the Bench, by which they may be often well directed in forming <em>their own opinion</em>; which, ‘and not anothers,’ is the opinion they are to return <em>upon their oaths</em>. But where, after due attention to all that the judge has said, they are decidedly of a different opinion from him, they have not only a <em>power and a right</em>, but they are <em>bound in conscience</em> to bring in a verdict accordingly.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The World</i> is described by Gifford in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Baviad and Marviad</i>, as a paper set up by “a knot of fantastic coxcombs to direct the taste of the town.” Lowndes (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Bibl.</abbr> <abbr>Man.</abbr></i> <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1871, page 2994) confounds it with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The World</i> mentioned <a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-257">here</a>.

					<p>Hawkins says (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 84) that “Johnson was never greedy of money, but without money could not be stimulated to write.

There is a good engraved portrait of him by Pether, from a picture by Fry, which hangs in the hall of the Scriveners’ company. I visited him October 4, 1790, in his ninety-third year, and found his judgment distinct and clear, and his memory, though faded so as to fail him occasionally, yet, as he assured me, and I indeed perceived, able to serve him very well, after a little recollection. It was agreeable to observe, that he was free from the discontent and fretfulness which too often molest old age. He in the summer of that year walked to Rotherhithe, where he dined, and walked home in the evening. He died on the 31st of December, 1791. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

					<p>In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Monthly Review</i> for May, 1792, there is such a correction of the above passage, as I should think myself very culpable not to subjoin. “This account is very inaccurate. The following statement of facts we know to be true, in every material circumstance:⁠—Shiels was the principal collector and digester of the materials for the work: but as he was very raw in authorship, an indifferent writer in prose, and his language full of Scotticisms, Cibber, who was a clever, lively fellow, and then soliciting employment among the booksellers, was engaged to correct the style and diction of the whole work, then intended to make only four volumes, with power to alter, expunge, or add, as he liked. He was also to supply <em>notes</em>, occasionally, especially concerning those dramatic poets with whom he had been chiefly conversant. He also engaged to write several of the Lives; which, (as we are told,) he, accordingly, performed. He was farther useful in striking out the Jacobitical and Tory sentiments, which Shiels had industriously interspersed wherever he could bring them in:⁠—and, as the success of the work appeared, after all, very doubtful, he was content with twenty-one pounds for his labour beside a few sets of the books, to disperse among his friends.⁠—Shiels had nearly seventy pounds, beside the advantage of many of the best Lives in the work being communicated by friends to the undertaking; and for which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Shiels had the same consideration as for the rest, being paid by the sheet, for the whole. He was, however, so angry with his Whiggish supervisor, (He, like his father, being a violent stickler for the political principles which prevailed in the Reign of George the Second,) for so unmercifully mutilating his copy, and scouting his politics, that he wrote Cibber a challenge: but was prevented from sending it, by the publisher, who fairly laughed him out of his fury. The proprietors, too, were discontented, in the end, on account of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cibber’s unexpected industry; for his corrections and alterations in the proof-sheets were so numerous and considerable, that the printer made for them a grievous addition to his bill; and, in fine, all parties were dissatisfied. On the whole, the work was productive of no profit to the undertakers, who had agreed, in case of success, to make Cibber a present of some addition to the twenty guineas which he had received, and for which his receipt is now in the booksellers’ hands. We are farther assured, that he actually obtained an additional sum; when he, soon after, (in the year 1758,) unfortunately embarked for Dublin, on an engagement for one of the theatres there: but the ship was cast away, and every person on board perished. There were about sixty passengers, among whom was the Earl of Drogheda, with many other persons of consequence and property. [<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> 1758, page 555.]</p>
					<p>“As to the alledged design of making the compilement pass for the work of old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cibber, the charges seem to have been founded on a somewhat uncharitable construction. We are assured that the thought was not harboured by some of the proprietors, who are still living; and we hope that it did not occur to the first designer of the work, who was also the printer of it, and who bore a respectable character.</p>
					<p>“We have been induced to enter thus circumstantially into the foregoing detail of facts relating to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Lives of the Poets</i>, compiled by <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Cibber and Shiels, from a sincere regard to that sacred principle of Truth, to which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson so rigidly adhered, according to the best of his knowledge; and which we believe, <em>no consideration</em> would have prevailed on him to violate. In regard to the matter, which we now dismiss, he had, no doubt, been misled by partial and wrong information: Shiels was the Doctor’s amanuensis; he had quarrelled with Cibber; it is natural to suppose that he told his story in his own way; and it is certain that <em>he</em> was not ‘a very sturdy moralist.’ [The quotation is from Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 116.] This explanation appears to me very satisfactory. It is, however, to be observed, that the story told by Johnson does not rest solely upon my record of his conversation; for he himself has published it in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Hammond</i> [<i>ib</i>. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 90], where he says, ‘the manuscript of Shiels is now in my possession.’ Very probably he had trusted to Shiels’s word, and never looked at it so as to compare it with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Lives of the Poets</i>, as published under <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cibber’s name. What became of that manuscript I know not. I should have liked much to examine it. I suppose it was thrown into the fire in that impetuous combustion of papers, which Johnson I think rashly executed, when <i xml:lang="la">moribundus</i>.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker, quoting a letter by Griffiths the publisher, says:⁠—“The question is now decided by this letter in opposition to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s assertion.” Croker’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Boswell</i>, page 818. The evidence of such an infamous fellow as Griffiths is worthless. (For his character see Forster’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Goldsmith</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 161.) As the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Monthly Review</i> was his property, the passage quoted by Boswell was, no doubt, written by his direction. D’Israeli (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Curiosities of Literature</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1834, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 375) says that Oldys (<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-175">here</a>) made annotations on a copy of Langbaine’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dramatic Poets</i>. “This <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Langbaine</i>, with additions by Coxeter, was bought by Theophilus Cibber; on the strength of these notes he prefixed his name to the first collection of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of Our Poets</i>, written chiefly by Shiels.” <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-2946" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“The story of this publication is remarkable. The whole book was printed twice over, a great part of it three times, and many sheets four or five times. The booksellers paid for the first impression; but the charges and repeated operations of the press were at the expense of the author, whose ambitious accuracy is known to have cost him at least a thousand pounds. He began to print in 1755. Three volumes appeared in 1764, and the conclusion in 1771. Andrew Reid undertook to persuade Lyttelton, as he had persuaded himself, that he was master of the secret of punctuation; and, as fear begets credulity, he was employed, I know not at what price, to point the pages of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Henry the Second</i>. When time brought the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History</i> to a third edition, Reid was either dead or discarded; and the superintendence of typography and punctuation was committed to a man originally a comb-maker, but then known by the style of Doctor.

					<p>On May 10, 1768, on which day the new parliament met, a great body of people gathered round the King’s Bench prison in <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s Fields in expectation that Wilkes would go thence to the House of Commons. Some kind of a riot arose, a proclamation was made in the terms of the Riot-Act, and the soldiers firing by order of Justice Gillam, killed five or six on the spot. The justice and one of the soldiers were on the coroner’s inquest brought in guilty of wilful murder, and two other soldiers of aiding and abetting therein. With great difficulty the prisoners were saved from the rage of the populace. They were all acquitted however. At Gillam’s trial the judge ruled in his favour, so that the case did not go to the jury. Of the trial of one of the soldiers “no account was allowed to be published by authority.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Annual Register</i> 1768, pages 108⁠–⁠9, 112, 136⁠–⁠8, 233. Professor Dicey (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Law of the Constitution</i>, page 308) points out that “the position of a soldier may be both in theory and practice, a difficult one. He may, as it has been well said, be liable to be shot by a court-martial if he disobeys an order, and to be hanged by a judge and jury if he obeys it.” The remembrance of these cases was perhaps the cause of the feebleness shown in the Gordon Riots in June 1780. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Franklin wrote from London on May 14, 1768 (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 315):⁠—“Even this capital is now a daily scene of lawless riot. Mobs patrolling the streets at noonday, some knocking all down that will not roar for Wilkes and liberty; courts of justice afraid to give judgment against him; coal-heavers and porters pulling down the houses of coal-merchants that refuse to give them more wages; sawyers destroying sawmills; sailors unrigging all the outward-bound ships, and suffering none to sail till merchants agree to raise their pay; watermen destroying private boats, and threatening bridges; soldiers firing among the mobs and killing men, women, and children.” “While I am writing,” he adds (<i>ib</i>. page 316), “a great mob of coal-porters fill the street, carrying a wretch of their business upon poles to be ducked for working at the old wages.” See also <i>ib</i>. page 402. Hume agreed with Johnson about the “imbecility” of the government; but he drew from it different conclusions. He wrote on <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 27, 1775, about the addresses to the King:⁠—“I wish they would advise him first to punish those insolent rascals in London and Middlesex, who daily insult him and the whole legislature, before he thinks of America. Ask him, how he can expect that a form of government will maintain an authority at 3000 miles’ distance, when it cannot make itself be respected, or even be treated with common decency, at home.” J.

					<p>My very pleasant friend himself, as well as others <em>who remember old stories</em>, will no doubt be surprised, when I observe that John Wilkes here shows himself to be of the <b>Warburtonian School</b>. It is nevertheless true, as appears from <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hurd the Bishop of Worcester’s very elegant commentary and notes on the “<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Epistola ad Pisones</i>.”</p>
					<p>It is necessary to a fair consideration of the question, that the whole passage in which the words occur should be kept in view:</p>
					<p>“Si quid inexpertum scenae committis, et audes~~~Personam formare novam, servetur ad imum~~~Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.~~~Difficile est propriè communia dicere: tuque~~~Rectiùs Iliacum carmen deducis in actus,~~~Quàm si proferres ignota indictaque primus,~~~Publica materies privati juris erit, si~~~Non circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem,~~~Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus~~~Interpres; nee desilies imitator in artum~~~Unde pedem proferre pudor vetat aut operis lex.”</p>
					<p>The “Commentary” thus illustrates it: “But the formation of quite <em>new characters</em> is a work of great difficulty and hazard. For here there is no generally received and fixed <em>archetype</em> to work after, but everyone <em>judges</em> of common right, according to the extent and comprehension of his own idea; therefore he advises to labour and refit <em>old characters and subjects</em>, particularly those made known and authorised by the practice of Homer and the Epic writers.”</p>
					<p>The “Note” is,</p>
					<p>“<i>Difficile</i> <b>est proprie communia dicere</b>.” Lambin’s Comment is, “<i xml:lang="la">Communia hoc loco appellat Horatius argumenta fabularum à nullo adhuc tractata: et ita, quae cuivis exposita sunt et in medio quodammodo posita, quasi vacua et à nemine occupata.</i>” And that this is the true meaning of <i xml:lang="la">communia</i> is evidently fixed by the words <i xml:lang="la">ignota indictaque</i>, which are explanatory of it; so that the sense given it in the commentary is unquestionably the right one. Yet, notwithstanding the clearness of the case, a late critic has this strange passage: “<i xml:lang="la">Difficile quidem esse propriè communia dicere, hoc est, materiam vulgarem, notam et è medio petitam, ita immutare atque exornare, ut nova et scriptori propria videatur, ultra concedimus; et maximi procul dubio ponderis ista est observatio. Sed omnibus utrinque collatis, et tum difficilis, tum venusti, tam judicii quam ingenii ratione habitá, major videtur esse gloria fabulam formare penitùs novam, quàm veterem, utcunque mutatam, de novo exhibere</i>. (Poet. Prael. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> page 164.) Where, having first put a wrong construction on the word <i xml:lang="la">communia</i>, he employs it to introduce an impertinent criticism. For where does the poet prefer the glory of refitting <em>old</em> subjects to that of inventing new ones? The contrary is implied in what he urges about the superior difficulty of the latter, from which he dissuades his countrymen, only in respect of their abilities and inexperience in these matters; and in order to cultivate in them, which is the main view of the Epistle, a spirit of correctness, by sending them to the old subjects, treated by the Greek writers.”</p>
					<p>For my own part (with all deference for <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hurd, who thinks the <em>case clear</em>,) I consider the passage, “<i xml:lang="la">Difficile est propriè communia dicere</i>,” to be a <em>crux</em> for the critics on Horace.</p>
					<p>The explication which My Lord of Worcester treats with so much contempt, is nevertheless countenanced by authority which I find quoted by the learned Baxter in his edition of Horace: “<em>Difficile est propriè communia dicere</em>, h.e. res vulgares disertis verbis enarrare, vel humile thema cum dignitate tractare. <em>Difficile est communes res propriis explicare verbis</em>. Vet. Schol.” I was much disappointed to find that the great critic, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Bentley, has no note upon this very difficult passage, as from his vigorous and illuminated mind I should have expected to receive more satisfaction than I have yet had.</p>
					<p>Sanadon thus treats of it: “<i xml:lang="fr">Propriè communia dicere; c’est à dire, qu’il n’est pas aisé de former à ces personnages d’imagination, des caractêres particuliers et cependant vraisemblables. Comme l’on a eté le maitre de les former tels qu’on a voulu, les fautes que l’on fait en cela sont moins pardonnables. C’est pourquoi Horace conseille de prendre toujours des sujets connus tels que sont par exemple ceux que l’on peut tirer des poèmes d’Homere.</i>”</p>
					<p>And Dacier observes upon it, “<i xml:lang="fr">Apres avoir marqué les deux qualités qu’il faut donner aux personnages qu’on invente, il conseille aux Poêtes tragiques, de n’user pas trop facilement de cette liberté quils ont d’en inventer, car il est três difficile de reussir dans ces nouveaux caractêres. Il est mal aisé, dit Horace, <em>de traiter proprement</em>, c’st à dire <em>convenablement</em>, des <em>sujets communs</em>; c’est à dire, des sujets inventés, et qui n’ont aucun fondement ni dans l’Histoire ni dans la Fable; et il les appelle <em>communs</em>, parce qu’ils sont en disposition à tout le monde, et que tout le monde a le droit de les inventer, et qu’ils sont, comme on dit, au premier occupant.</i>” See his observations at large on this expression and the following.</p>
					<p>After all, I cannot help entertaining some doubt whether the words, <i xml:lang="la">Difficile est propriè communia dicere</i>, may not have been thrown in by Horace to form a <em>separate</em> article in a “choice of difficulties’ which a poet has to encounter, who chooses a new subject; in which case it must be uncertain which of the various explanations is the true one, and every reader has a right to decide as it may strike his own fancy. And even should the words be understood as they generally are, to be connected both with what goes before and what comes after, the exact sense cannot be absolutely ascertained; for instance, whether <i xml:lang="fr">propriè</i> is meant to signify <q>in an appropriated manner</q>, as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson here understands it, or, as it is often used by Cicero, <q>with propriety</q>, or <q>elegantly</q>. In short, it is a rare instance of a defect in perspicuity in an admirable writer, who with almost every species of excellence, is peculiarly remarkable for that quality. The length of this note perhaps requires an apology. Many of my readers, I doubt not, will admit that a critical discussion of a passage in a favourite classic is very engaging. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

					<p>He however upon seeing <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Warton’s name to the suggestion, that the Epitaph should be in English, observed to Sir Joshua, “I wonder that Joe Warton, a scholar by profession, should be such a fool.” He said too, “I should have thought Mund Burke would have had more sense.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton, who was one of the company at Sir Joshua’s, like a sturdy scholar, resolutely refused to sign the “Round Robin”. The Epitaph is engraved upon <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Goldsmith’s monument without any alteration. At another time, when somebody endeavoured to argue in favour of its being in English, Johnson said, “The language of the country of which a learned man was a native, is not the language fit for his epitaph, which should be in ancient and permanent language. Consider, Sir; how you should feel, were you to find at Rotterdam an epitaph upon Erasmus <em>in Dutch</em>!” For my own part I think it would be best to have Epitaphs written both in a learned language, and in the language of the country; so that they might have the advantage of being more universally understood, and at the same time be secured of classical stability. I cannot, however, but be of opinion, that it is not sufficiently discriminative. Applying to Goldsmith equally the epithets of “<i xml:lang="la">Poetae</i>, <i xml:lang="la">Historici</i>, <i xml:lang="la">Physici</i>,” is surely not right; for as to his claim to the last of those epithets, I have heard Johnson himself say, “Goldsmith, Sir, will give us a very fine book upon the subject; but if he can distinguish a cow from a horse, that, I believe, may be the extent of his knowledge of natural history.” His book is indeed an excellent performance, though in some instances he appears to have trusted too much to Buffon, who, with all his theoretical ingenuity and extraordinary eloquence, I suspect had little actual information in the science on which he wrote so admirably. For instance, he tells us that the <em>cow</em> sheds her horns every two years; a most palpable error, which Goldsmith has faithfully transferred into his book. It is wonderful that Buffon, who lived so much in the country, at his noble seat, should have fallen into such a blunder. I suppose he has confounded the <em>cow</em> with the <em>deer</em>. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

					<p>It was not “last year” but on June 22, 1772, that the negro, James Somerset⁠—who had been brought to England by his master, had escaped from him, had been seized, and confined in irons on board a ship in The Thames that was bound for Jamaica, and had been brought on a writ of Habeas Corpus before the Court of King’s Bench was discharged by Lord Mansfield. Howell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">State Trials</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XX</span> 79, and Lofft’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reports</i>, 1772, page 1. “Lord Mansfield,” writes Lord Campbell (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Chief Justices</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 418), “first established the grand doctrine that the air of England is too pure to be breathed by a slave.” According to Lord Campbell, Mansfield’s judgment thus ended:⁠—“The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it. Every man who comes into England is entitled to the protection of English law, whatever oppression he may heretofore have suffered, and whatever may be the colour of his skin:</p>
					<p>“ ‘Quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus esses.’</p>
					<p>“Let the negro be discharged.”</p>
					<p>Where Lord Campbell found this speech, that is to say if he did not put it together himself, I cannot guess. Mansfield’s judgment was very brief. He says in the conclusion:⁠—“The only question before us is, whether the cause on the return [to the writ of habeas corpus] is sufficient. If it is, the negro must be remanded; if it is not, he must be discharged. Accordingly the return states that the slave departed, and refused to serve; whereupon he was kept to be sold abroad. So high an act of dominion must be recognised by the law of the country where it is used. The power of a master over his slave has been extremely different in different countries. The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political.⁠ ⁠… It is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law. Whatever inconveniences therefore may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.” Lofft’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reports</i>, 1772, page 19. “The judgment of the court,” says Broom (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Constitutional Law</i>, 1885, page 99), “was delivered by Lord Mansfield, C.J., after some delay, and with evident reluctance.” The passage about the air of England that Campbell puts into Mansfield’s mouth is found in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hargrave’s argument on May 14, 1772, where he speaks of England as “a soil whose air is deemed too pure for slaves to breathe in.” Lofft’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reports</i>, page 2. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dunning replied:⁠—“Let me take notice, neither the air of England is too pure for a slave to breathe in, nor the laws of England have rejected servitude.” <i>Ib</i>. page 12.

He means only to be frank, and manly, and independent, and perhaps, as you say, a little wise. To be frank he thinks is to be cynical, and to be independent is to be rude.

The next day he packed up his cloke-bag, which he had not done for three years, and sent it to town; and while we were wondering what he would say about it at breakfast, he was walking to London himself, without taking leave of any one person, except it may be the girl, who owns they had much talk, in the course of which he expressed great aversion to me and even to her, who, [<i>sic</i>] he said, he once thought well of.” Hayward’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 339. Baretti, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Eur. Mag.</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> 398, told his story. He said:⁠—“Madam took it into her head to give herself airs, and treat me with some coldness and superciliousness.

Johnson had made me hope that Thrale would at last give me an annuity for my pains, but, never receiving a shilling from him or from her, I grew tired at last, and on some provocation from her left them abruptly.” It should seem that he afterwards made it up with them, for in a note on volume <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> page 191, he says of the day of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale’s death, “Johnson and I, and many other friends, were to dine with him that day.” The rest of the note, at all events, is inaccurate, for he says that “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale imparted to Johnson the news [of her husband’s death],” whereas Johnson saw him die. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3142" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Johnson, I believe, at this time suffered less than usual from despondency. See <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2932">this note</a>. The passage in which these words are found applies to one day only. It is as follows:⁠—“March 28. This day is Good Friday. It is likewise the day on which my poor Tetty was taken from me. My thoughts were disturbed in bed. I remembered that it was my wife’s dying day, and begged pardon for all our sins, and commended her; but resolved to mix little of my own sorrows or cares with the great solemnity. Having taken only tea without milk I went to church; had time before service to commend my wife, and wished to join quietly in the service, but I did not hear well, and my mind grew unsettled and perplexed. Having rested ill in the night I slumbered at the sermon, which, I think, I could not as I sat perfectly hear.⁠ ⁠… At night I had some ease. L.D. [Laus Deo] I had prayed for pardon and peace.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prayers and Meditations</i> page 153. Hawkins, however (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 532), says, perhaps with considerable exaggeration, that at this time, “he sunk into indolence, till his faculties seemed to be impaired; deafness grew upon him; long intervals of mental absence interrupted his conversation, and it was difficult to engage his attention to any subject. His friends concluded that his lamp was emitting its last rays, but the lapse of a short period gave them ample proofs to the contrary.” The proofs were <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Lives of the Poets</i>.

					<p>Horace Walpole says “the criminal was raised to the dignity of a confessor in the eyes of the people⁠—but an inexorable judge had already pronounced his doom. Lord Mansfield, who never felt pity, and never relented unless terrified, had indecently declared for execution even before the judges had given their opinion. An incident that seemed favourable weighed down the vigorous [qu. rigorous] scale. The Common Council had presented a petition for mercy to the king. Lord Mansfield, who hated the popular party as much as he loved severity, was not likely to be moved by such intercessors. At Court it grew the language that the king must discountenance such interposition.” Walpole adds that “as an attempt to rescue Dodd might be apprehended, two thousand men were ordered to be reviewed in Hyde Park during the execution.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal of the Reign of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 125. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3224" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The king signs no sentences or death warrants; but out of respect to the Royal perogative of mercy, expressed by the old adage, “<q>The King’s face gives grace</q>,” the cases of criminals convicted in London, where the king is supposed to be resident, were reported to him by the recorder, that his Majesty might have an option of pardoning. Hence it was seriously doubted whether a recorder’s report need or, indeed, could be made at Windsor. All his Majesty did on these occasions was, to express verbally his assent or dissent to or from the execution of the sentence; and, though the King was on such occasions attended by his Ministers and the great legal Privy Councillors, the business was not technically a council business, but the individual act of the King. On the accession of Queen Victoria, the nature of some cases that it might be necessary to report to her Majesty occasioned the abrogation of a practice which was certainly so far unreasonable that it made a difference between London and all the rest of the kingdom. <cite>—Croker</cite>. “I was exceedingly shocked,” said Lord Eldon, “the first time I attended to hear the Recorder’s report, at the careless manner in which, as it appeared to me, it was conducted. We were called upon to decide on sentences affecting no less than the lives of men, and yet there was nothing laid before us to enable us to judge whether there had or had not been any extenuating circumstances; it was merely a recapitulation of the judge’s opinion and the sentence. I resolved that I never would attend another report, without having read and duly considered the whole of the evidence of each case, and I never did.” Twiss’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Eldon</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 398. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3226" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“My Ever Dear and Much-Respected Sir,</p>
					<p>“You know my solemn enthusiasm of mind. You love me for it, and I respect myself for it, because in so far I resemble <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson. You will be agreeably surprised when you learn the reason of my writing this letter. I am at Wittemberg in Saxony. I am in the old church where the Reformation was first preached, and where some of the reformers lie interred. I cannot resist the serious pleasure of writing to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnson from the Tomb of Melancthon. My paper rests upon the gravestone of that great and good man, who was undoubtedly the worthiest of all the reformers. He wished to reform abuses which had been introduced into the Church; but had no private resentment to gratify. So mild was he, that when his aged mother consulted him with anxiety on the perplexing disputes of the times, he advised her ‘to keep to the old religion.’ At this tomb, then, my ever dear and respected friend! I vow to thee an eternal attachment. It shall be my study to do what I can to render your life happy: and, if you die before me, I shall endeavour to do honour to your memory; and, elevated by the remembrance of you, persist in noble piety. May <b>God</b>, the Father of all beings, ever bless you! and may you continue to love,</p>

					<p>“My Dear Sir<!-- salutation -->,</p>
					<p>“Every scene of my life confirms the truth of what you have told me, ‘there is no certain happiness in this state of being.’⁠—I am here, amidst all that you know is at Lord Pembroke’s; and yet I am weary and gloomy. I am just setting out for the house of an old friend in Devonshire, and shall not get back to London for a week yet. You said to me last Good-Friday, with a cordiality that warmed my heart, that if I came to settle in London, we should have a day fixed every week, to meet by ourselves and talk freely. To be thought worthy of such a privilege cannot but exalt me. During my present absence from you, while, notwithstanding the gaiety which you allow me to possess, I am darkened by temporary clouds, I beg to have a few lines from you; a few lines merely of kindness, as⁠—a <em>viaticum</em> till I see you again. In your <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Vanity of Human Wishes</i>, and in Parnell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Contentment</i>, I find the only sure means of enjoying happiness; or, at least, the hopes of happiness.

Besides the other objects of curiosity and observation, to have seen my illustrious friend received, as he probably would have been, by a Prince so eminently distinguished for his variety of talents and acquisitions as the late King of Sweden; and by the Empress of Russia, whose extraordinary abilities, information, and magnanimity, astonish the world, would have afforded a noble subject for contemplation and record. This reflection may possibly be thought too visionary by the more sedate and cold-blooded part of my readers; yet I own, I frequently indulge it with an earnest, unavailing regret. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Spectator</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 436, Hockley in the Hole is described as “a place of no small renown for the gallantry of the lower order of Britons.” Fielding mentions it in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Jonathan Wild</i>, bk. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> chapter 2:⁠—“Jonathan married Elizabeth, daughter of Scragg Hollow, of Hockley in the Hole, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>, and by her had Jonathan, who is the illustrious subject of these memoirs.” In <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">The Beggar’s Opera</i>, act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Peachum says to Filch: “You should go to Hockley in the Hole, and to Marylebone, child, to learn valour.

That Johnson had this valour was shown two years earlier, when he wrote to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale about a sum of £14,000 that the Thrales had received: “If I had money enough, what would I do? Perhaps, if you and master did not hold me, I might go to Cairo, and down the Red Sea to Bengal, and take a ramble in India. Would this be better than building and planting?

You cannot imagine how well. The chapel was dressed with orange and myrtle, and there wanted nothing but a little incense to drive away the devil⁠—or to invite him. Prayers then began, psalms and a sermon; the latter by a young clergyman, one Dodd, who contributed to the Popish idea one had imbibed, by haranguing entirely in the French style, and very eloquently and touchingly. He apostrophised the lost sheep, who sobbed and cried from their souls: so did my Lady Hertford and Fanny Pelham, till, I believe, the city dames took them both for Jane Shores. The confessor then turned to the audience, and addressed himself to his Royal Highness, whom he called most illustrious prince, beseeching his protection. In short, it was a very pleasing performance, and I got <em>the most illustrious</em> to desire it might be printed.” <abbr>Dr.</abbr> A. Carlyle (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Auto.</abbr></i> page 503) heard Dodd preach in 1769. “We had,” he says, “difficulty to get tolerable seats, the crowd of genteel people was so great. The unfortunate young women were in a latticed gallery, where you could only see those who chose to be seen. The preacher’s text was, ‘If a man look on a woman to lust after her,’ <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> The text itself was shocking, and the sermon was composed with the least possible delicacy, and was a shocking insult on a sincere penitent, and fuel for the warm passions of the hypocrites. The fellow was handsome, and delivered his discourse remarkably well for a reader. When he had finished, there were unceasing whispers of applause, which I could not help contradicting aloud, and condemning the whole institution, as well as the exhibition of the preacher, as <i xml:lang="la">contra bonos mores</i>, and a disgrace to a Christian city.” Goldsmith in 1774 exposed Dodd as a “quacking divine” in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Retaliation</i>.

					<p>In this censure which has been carelessly uttered, I carelessly joined. But in justice to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Kippis, who with that manly candid good temper which marks his character, set me right, I now with pleasure retract it; and I desire it may be particularly observed, as pointed out by him to me, that “The new lives of dissenting Divines in the first four volumes of the second edition of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Biographia Brittanica</i>, are those of John Abernethy, Thomas Amory, George Benson, Hugh Broughton the learned Puritan, Simon Browne, Joseph Boyse of Dublin, Thomas Cartwright the learned Puritan, and Samuel Chandler. The only doubt I have ever heard suggested is, whether there should have been an article of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Amory. But I was convinced, and am still convinced, that he was entitled to one, from the reality of his learning, and the excellent and candid nature of his practical writings.</p>
					<p>“The new lives of clergymen of the Church of England, in the same four volumes, are as follows: John Balguy, Edward Bentham, George Berkley Bishop of Cloyne, William Berriman, Thomas Birch, William Borlase, Thomas Bott, James Bradley, Thomas Broughton, John Brown, John Burton, Joseph Butler Bishop of Durham, Thomas Carte, Edmund Castell, Edmund Chishull, Charles Churchill, William Clarke, Robert Clayton Bishop of Clogher, John Conybeare Bishop of Bristol, George Costard, and Samuel Croxall.⁠—‘I am not conscious (says <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Kippis) of any partiality in conducting the work. I would not willingly insert a Dissenting Minister that does not justly deserve to be noticed, or omit an established Clergyman that does. At the same time, I shall not be deterred from introducing Dissenters into the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Biographia</i>, when I am satisfied that they are entitled to that distinction, from their writings, learning, and merit.’ ”</p>
					<p>Let me add that the expression “A friend to the Constitution in Church and State,” was not meant by me, as any reflection upon this reverend gentleman, as if he were an enemy to the political constitution of his country, as established at the revolution, but, from my steady and avowed predilection for a <em>Tory</em>, was quoted from Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dictionary</i>, where that distinction is so defined. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

					<p>“So when a child, as playful children use,~~~Has burnt to tinder a stale last year’s news,~~~The flame extinct he views the roving fire,~~~There goes my lady, and there goes the squire,~~~There goes the parson, oh! illustrious spark,~~~And there, scarce less illustrious, goes the clerk.”</p>

At last he was seized with the stone; and a friend who found him in one of its severest fits, having expressed his concern, “No, no, Sir, (said he) don’t pity me: what I now feel is ease compared with that torture of mind from which it relieves me.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3356" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

In the first Johnson signs himself:⁠—“Your very affectionate,” (page 304). On <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 18, 1756, he writes:⁠—“Neither of us now can find many whom he has known so long as we have known each other.⁠ ⁠… We both stand almost single in the world,” (page 324). On July 15, 1765, he reproaches Taylor with not writing:⁠—“With all your building and feasting you might have found an hour in some wet day for the remembrance of your old friend. I should have thought that since you have led a life so festive and gay, you would have [invited] me to partake of your hospitality,” (page 383). On <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 19, 1779, he says:⁠—“Write to me soon. We are both old. How few of those whom we have known in our youth are left alive!” (page 461). On April 12, 1784, he writes:⁠—“Let us be kind to one another. I have no friend now living but you and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hector that was the friend of my youth,” (page 482, and <i>post</i>, April 12, 1784). See <i>ante</i>, page 131, for his regret on the death of his schoolfellow, Henry Jackson, who seemed to Boswell (<i>ante</i>, under March 22, 1776) to be a low man, dull and untaught. “One of the old man’s miseries,” he wrote, (<i>post</i>, <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 3, 1778), “is that he cannot easily find a companion able to partake with him of the past.” “I have none to call me Charley now,” wrote Charles Lamb on the death of a friend of his boyhood (Talfourd’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lamb</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1865, page 145). Such a companion Johnson found in Taylor. That, on the death of his wife, he at once sent for him, not even waiting for the light of morning to come, is a proof that he had a strong affection for the man. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3366" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Campbell warned him that he would fire if he did not keep off, and kept retiring backwards or sideways. He stumbled and fell. Lord Eglintoune stopped a little, and then made as if he would advance. Campbell thereupon fired, and hit him in the side. He was found guilty of murder.

Moreover he disliked appeals to history. “General history,” writes Murphy (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 138), “had little of his regard. Biography was his delight.

On his master’s petition to the Justices of Peace of Perthshire, he was brought before them on a warrant; they decided that he must continue with him as formerly. For some time he continued accordingly; but a child being born to him, he petitioned the Sheriff, who decided in his favour.

We saw her often in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, and in that town, where there was no audience for such an actress as she was, her natural character was displayed, which was that of an active manager of her affairs, a crafty chaperon, and a keen pursuer of her interest, not to be outdone by the sharpest coal-dealer on the Tyne; but in this capacity she was not displeasing, for she was not acting a part.” <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-3551" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He wrote, he says, among other works, an English, a Latin, a Greek, a Hebrew, and a French Grammar, a Treatise on Logic and another on Electricity. In the British Isles he had travelled perhaps more than any man of his time, and he had visited North America and more than one country of Europe.

					<p>It was only in hay-time and harvest that Marshall approved of Sunday work. He had seen in the wet harvest of 1775 so much corn wasted that he “was ambitious to set the patriotic example” of Sunday labour. One Sunday he “promised every man who would work two shillings, as much roast beef and plumb pudding as he would eat, with as much ale as it might be fit for him to drink.” Nine men and three boys came. In a note in the edition of 1799, he says:⁠—“The Author has been informed that an old law exists (mentioned by Dugdale), which tolerates husbandmen in working on Sundays in harvest; and that, in proof thereof, a gentleman in the north has uniformly carried one load every year on a Sunday.” He adds:⁠—“<abbr>Jan.</abbr> 1799.

					<p>Certainly not Horace Walpole, as had been suggested to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker. He and Johnson can scarcely be said to have known each other (<i>post</i>, under June 19, 1784, note). A sentence in one of Walpole’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 407) shows that he was very unlike the French wit. On <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 22, 1765, he wrote from Paris:⁠—“The French affect philosophy, literature, and freethinking: the first never did, and never will possess me; of the two others I have long been tired. <em>Freethinking is for one’s self, surely not for society</em>.” Perhaps Richard Fitzpatrick is meant, who later on joined in writing <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Rolliad</i>, and who was the cousin and “sworn brother” of Charles Fox. Walpole describes him as “an agreeable young man of parts,” and mentions his “genteel irony and badinage.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journal of the Reign of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span></i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 167 and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 560.

					<p>“I do not (says <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Malone) see any difficulty in this passage, and wonder that <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson should have acknowledged it to be <em>inaccurate</em>.

The plain meaning, therefore, is, ‘To clear his doubts concerning Providence, and to obtain some knowledge of the world by actual experience; to see whether the accounts furnished by books, or by the oral communications of swains, were just representations of it; [I say, <em>swains</em>,] for his oral or <span xml:lang="la">viva voce</span> information had been obtained from that part of mankind <em>alone</em>, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>’ The word <q>alone</q> here does not relate to the whole of the preceding line, as has been supposed, but, by a common licence, to the words⁠—<q>of all mankind</q>, which are understood, and of which it is restrictive.”</p>

These are the moments of which poor Sober trembles at the thought. But the misery of these tiresome intervals he has many means of alleviating.⁠ ⁠… His daily amusement is chemistry. He has a small furnace which he employs in distillation, and which has long been the solace of his life. He draws oils and waters, and essences and spirits, which he knows to be of no use; sits and counts the drops as they come from his retort, and forgets that whilst a drop is falling a moment flies away.” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi says (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Anecdotes</i> page 236):⁠—“We made up a sort of laboratory at Streatham one summer, and diverted ourselves with drawing essences and colouring liquors. But the danger <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale found his friend in one day, when he got the children and servants round him to see some experiments performed, put an end to all our entertainment.” <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-4068" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Miss Burney shows how luxurious a table <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale kept. “We had,” she records, in May 1779, “a very grand dinner today, <em>though nothing to a Streatham dinner</em>, at the Ship Tavern [Brighton], where the officers mess, to which we were invited by the major and the captain.” As the major was a man of at least £8,000 a-year, and the captain of £4,000 or £5,000, the dinner was likely to be grand enough. <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 211. Yet when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale had his first stroke in 1779, Johnson wrote:⁠—“I am the more alarmed by this violent seizure, as I can impute it to no wrong practices, or intemperance of any kind.⁠ ⁠… What can he reform? or what can he add to his regularity and temperance?

Though he sat by Thrale at dinner, he never noticed whether he eat much or little. A strange man!” Yet in a note on page 49, Baretti had said that Thrale’s seizure was caused by “the mere grief he could not overcome of his only son’s loss. Johnson knew it, but would not tell it.” See <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4508">this note</a>. <a href="part-3.xhtml#noteref-4165" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Among the provisions thus relaxed was one that subjected Popish priests, or Papists keeping school, to perpetual imprisonment. Those only enjoyed the benefit of the act who took a very strict test, in which, among other things, they denied the Pope’s temporal and civil jurisdiction within this realm. This bill passed both Houses without a single negative. It applied only to England. Scotland was alarmed by the report that the Scotch Catholics were in like manner to be relieved. In Edinburgh and Glasgow the Papists suffered from outrageous acts of violence and cruelty, and government did not think it advisable to repress this persecution by force.

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Longley was Recorder of Rochester, and father of Archbishop Longley. To the kindness of his granddaughter, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Newton Smart, I owe the following extract from his manuscript <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Autobiography</i>:⁠—“<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson and General Paoli came down to visit <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton, and I was asked to meet them, when the conversation took place mentioned by Boswell, in which Johnson gave me more credit for knowledge of the Greek metres than I deserved. There was some question about anapaestics, concerning which I happened to remember what Foster used to tell us at Eton, that the whole line to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="la">Basis Anapaestica</i> was considered but as one verse, however divided in the printing, and consequently the syllables at the end of each line were not common, as in other metres. This observation was new to Johnson, and struck him. Had he examined me farther, I fear he would have found me ignorant. Langton was a very good Greek scholar, much superior to Johnson, to whom nevertheless he paid profound deference, sometimes indeed I thought more than he deserved. The next day I dined at Langton’s with Johnson, I remember Lady Rothes [Langton’s wife] spoke of the advantage children now derived from the little books published purposely for their instruction. Johnson controverted it, asserting that at an early age it was better to gratify curiosity with wonders than to attempt planting truth, before the mind was prepared to receive it, and that therefore, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Jack the Giant-Killer</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parisenus and Parismenus</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Seven Champions of Christendom</i> were fitter for them than <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Barbauld and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Trimmer.” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Piozzi (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Anecdotes</i> page 16) says:⁠—“<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson used to condemn me for putting Newbery’s books into children’s hands. ‘Babies do not want,’ said he, ‘to hear about babies; they like to be told of giants and castles, and of somewhat which can stretch and stimulate their little minds.’ When I would urge the numerous editions of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tommy Prudent</i> or <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Goody Two Shoes</i>; ‘Remember always,’ said he, ‘that the parents buy the books, and that the children never read them.” ’ For Johnson’s visit to Rochester, see <i>post</i>, July, 1783. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4256" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The difference between Johnson and Smith is apparent even in this slight instance. Smith was a man of extraordinary application, and had his mind crowded with all manner of subjects; but the force, acuteness, and vivacity of Johnson were not to be found there. He had book-making so much in his thoughts, and was so chary of what might be turned to account in that way, that he once said to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that he made it a rule, when in company, never to talk of what he understood. Beauclerk had for a short time a pretty high opinion of Smith’s conversation. Garrick, after listening to him for a while, as to one of whom his expectations had been raised, turned slyly to a friend, and whispered him, “What say you to this?⁠—eh? <em>flabby</em>, I think.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> A. Carlyle (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Auto.</abbr></i> page 279), says:⁠—“Smith’s voice was harsh and enunciation thick, approaching to stammering. His conversation was not colloquial, but like lecturing. He was the most absent man in company that I ever saw, moving his lips, and talking to himself, and smiling in the midst of large companies. If you awaked him from his reverie and made him attend to the subject of conversation, he immediately began a harangue, and never stopped till he told you all he knew about it, with the utmost philosophical ingenuity.” Dugald Stewart (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Adam Smith</i>, page 117) says that “his consciousness of his tendency to absence rendered his manner somewhat embarrassed in the company of strangers.” But “to his intimate friends, his peculiarities added an inexpressible charm to his conversation, while they displayed in the most interesting light the artless simplicity of his heart.” <i>Ib.</i> page 113.

					<p>A literary lady has favoured me with a characteristic anecdote of Richardson. One day at his country-house at Northend, where a large company was assembled at dinner, a gentleman who was just returned from Paris, willing to please <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richardson, mentioned to him a very flattering circumstance⁠—that he had seen his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Clarissa</i> lying on the King’s brother’s table. Richardson observing that part of the company were engaged in talking to each other, affected then not to attend to it. But by and by, when there was a general silence, and he thought that the flattery might be fully heard, he addressed himself to the gentleman, “I think, Sir, you were saying something about⁠—” pausing in a high flutter of expectation. The gentleman provoked at his inordinate vanity, resolved not to indulge it, and with an exquisitely sly air of indifference answered, “A mere trifle Sir, not worth repeating.” The mortification of Richardson was visible, and he did not speak ten words more the whole day. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson was present, and appeared to enjoy it much. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4329" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Of Johnson’s conduct towards Warburton, a very honourable notice is taken by the editor of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their respective Works</i>. After an able and “fond, though not undistinguishing,” consideration of Warburton’s character, he says, “In two immortal works, Johnson has stood forth in the foremost rank of his admirers. By the testimony of such a man, impertinence must be abashed, and malignity itself must be softened. Of literary merit, Johnson, as we all know, was a sagacious but a most severe judge. Such was his discernment, that he pierced into the most secret springs of human actions; and such was his integrity, that he always weighed the moral characters of his fellow-creatures in the ‘balance of the sanctuary.’ He was too courageous to propitiate a rival, and too proud to truckle to a superior. Warburton he knew, as I know him, and as every man of sense and virtue would wish to be known⁠—I mean, both from his own writings, and from the writings of those who dissented from his principles, or who envied his reputation. But, as to favours, he had never received or asked any from the Bishop of Gloucester; and, if my memory fails me not, he had seen him only once, when they met almost without design, conversed without much effort, and parted without any lasting impressions of hatred or affection. Yet, with all the ardour of sympathetic genius, Johnson has done that spontaneously and ably, which, by some writers, had been before attempted injudiciously, and which, by others, from whom more successful attempts might have been expected, has not <em>hitherto</em> been done at all. He spoke well of Warburton, without insulting those whom Warburton despised. He suppressed not the imperfections of this extraordinary man, while he endeavoured to do justice to his numerous and transcendental excellencies. He defended him when living, amidst the clamours of his enemies; and praised him when dead, amidst the <em>silence of his friends</em>.”</p>
					<p>Having availed myself of this editor’s eulogy on my departed friend, for which I warmly thank him, let me not suffer the lustre of his reputation, honestly acquired by profound learning and vigorous eloquence, to be tarnished by a charge of illiberality. He has been accused of invidiously dragging again into light certain writings of a person respectable by his talents, his learning, his station and his age, which were published a great many years ago, and have since, it is said, been silently given up by their author. But when it is considered that these writings were not <em>sins of youth</em>, but deliberate works of one well-advanced in life, overflowing at once with flattery to a great man of great interest in the Church, and with unjust and acrimonious abuse of two men of eminent merit; and that, though it would have been unreasonable to expect an humiliating recantation, no apology whatever has been made in the cool of the evening, for the oppressive fervour of the heat of the day; no slight relenting indication has appeared in any note, or any corner of later publications; is it not fair to understand him as superciliously persevering? When he allows the shafts to remain in the wounds, and will not stretch forth a lenient hand, is it wrong, is it not generous to become an indignant avenger? <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Boswell wrote on <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 16, 1789:⁠—“There is just come out a publication which makes a considerable noise. The celebrated <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parr, of Norwich, has⁠—wickedly, shall we say?⁠—but surely wantonly⁠—published Warburton’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Juvenile Translations and Discourse on Prodigies</i>, and Bishop Kurd’s attacks on Jortin and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Thomas Leland, with his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essay on the Delicacy of Friendship</i>.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters of Boswell</i>, page 275.

					<p>Let me here express my grateful remembrance of Lord Somerville’s kindness to me, at a very early period. He was the first person of high rank that took particular notice of me in the way most flattering to a young man, fondly ambitious of being distinguished for his literary talents; and by the honour of his encouragement made me think well of myself, and aspire to deserve it better. He had a happy art of communicating his varied knowledge of the world, in short remarks and anecdotes, with a quiet pleasant gravity, that was exceedingly engaging. Never shall I forget the hours which I enjoyed with him at his apartments in the Royal Palace of Holy-Rood House, and at his seat near Edinburgh, which he himself had formed with an elegant taste. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4406" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Boswell, I think, misunderstands Johnson. Johnson said (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 313) that “Pope’s admiration of the Great seems to have increased in the advance of life.” His <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> he had dedicated to Congreve, but “to his latter works he took care to annex names dignified with titles, but was not very happy in his choice; for, except Lord Bathurst, none of his noble friends were such as that a good man would wish to have his intimacy with them known to posterity; he can derive little honour from the notice of Cobham, Burlington, or Bolingbroke.” Johnson, it seems clear, is speaking, not of the noblemen whom Pope knew in general, but of those to whom he dedicated any of his works. Among them Lord Marchmont is not found, so that on him no slight is cast. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4408" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Neither does Johnson actually say that Lord Marchmont had “any concern,” though perhaps he implies it. He writes:⁠—“Pope left the care of his papers to his executors; first to Lord Bolingbroke; and, if he should not be living, to the Earl of Marchmont: undoubtedly expecting them to be proud of the trust, and eager to extend his fame. But let no man dream of influence beyond his life. After a decent time, Dodsley the bookseller went to solicit preference as the publisher, and was told that the parcel had not been yet inspected; and, whatever was the reason, the world has been disappointed of what was ‘reserved for the next age.’ ” <i>Ib.</i> page 306. As Bolingbroke outlived Pope by more than seven years, it is clear, from what Johnson states, that he alone had the care of the papers, and that he gave the answer to Dodsley.

					<p>Miss Burney gives an account of an attack made by Johnson, at a dinner at Streatham, in June 1781, on <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys (<i>post</i>, page 82), “one of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu’s steadiest abettors.” “Never before,” she writes, “have I seen <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson speak with so much passion. ‘<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys,’ he cried, in a voice the most enraged, ‘I understand you are offended by my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Lord Lyttelton</i>. What is it you have to say against it? Come forth, man! Here am I, ready to answer any charge you can bring.’ ” After the quarrel had been carried even into the drawing-room, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale, “with great spirit and dignity, said that she should be very glad to hear no more of it. Everybody was silenced, and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, after a pause, said:⁠—‘Well, Madam, you <em>shall</em> hear no more of it; yet I will defend myself in every part and in every atom.’⁠ ⁠… Thursday morning, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson went to town for some days, but not before <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale read him a very serious lecture upon giving way to such violence; which he bore with a patience and quietness that even more than made his peace with me.” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 45. Two months later the quarrel was made up. “<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys had desired this meeting by way of a reconciliation; and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson now made amends for his former violence, as he advanced to him, as soon as he came in, and holding out his hand to him received him with a cordiality he had never shown him before. Indeed he told me himself that he thought the better of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys for all that had passed.” <i>Ib.</i> page 82. Miss Burney, in <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1783, described the quarrel to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cambridge:⁠—“ ‘I never saw <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson really in a passion but then; and dreadful indeed it was to see. I wished myself away a thousand times. It was a frightful scene. He so red, poor <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Pepys so pale.’ ‘It was behaving ill to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale certainly to quarrel in her house.’ ‘Yes, but he never repeated it; though he wished of all things to have gone through just such another scene with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu; and to refrain was an act of heroic forbearance. She came to Streatham one morning, and I saw he was dying to attack her.’ ‘And how did <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Montagu herself behave?’ Very stately, indeed, at first. She turned from him very stiffly, and with a most distant air, and without even courtesying to him, and with a firm intention to keep to what she had publicly declared⁠—that she would never speak to him more. However, he went up to her himself, longing to begin, and very roughly said:⁠—‘Well, Madam, what’s become of your fine new house? I hear no more of it.’ ‘But how did she bear this?’ ‘Why, she was obliged to answer him; and she soon grew so frightened⁠—as everybody does⁠—that she was as civil as ever.’ He laughed heartily at this account. But I told him <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson was now much softened. He had acquainted me, when I saw him last, that he had written to her upon the death of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Williams [see <i>post</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 18, 1783, note], because she had allowed her something yearly, which now ceased. ‘And I had a very kind answer from her,’ said he. ‘Well then, Sir,’ cried I, ‘I hope peace now will be again proclaimed.’ ‘Why, I am now,’ said he, ‘come to that time when I wish all bitterness and animosity to be at an end.’ ” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 290. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4454" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The Solicitor-General has brought a bill into Parliament for this purpose. The bill is drawn artfully enough; for, as these societies are held on Sundays, and people pay for admittance, he has joined them with a famous tea-drinking house [Carlisle House], involving them both in the same fate, and entitling his bill, ‘A Bill to regulate certain Abuses and Profanations of the Lord’s Day’.” The Bill was carried; on a division none being found among the Noes but the two tellers.

					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilkes probably did not know that there is in an English sermon the most comprehensive and lively account of that entertaining faculty, for which he himself is so much admired. It is in <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Barrow’s first volume, and fourteenth sermon, “Against foolish Talking and Jesting.” My old acquaintance, the late Corbyn Morris, in his ingenious <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Essay on Wit, Humour, and Ridicule</i>, calls it “a <em>profuse</em> description of Wit;” but I do not see how it could be curtailed, without leaving out some good circumstance of discrimination. As it is not generally known, and may perhaps dispose some to read sermons, from which they may receive real advantage, while looking only for entertainment, I shall here subjoin it:⁠—“But first (says the learned preacher) it may be demanded, what the thing we speak of is? Or what this facetiousness (or <em>wit</em> as he calls it before) doth import? To which questions I might reply, as Democritus did to him that asked the definition of a man, ‘ “ ’Tis that which we all see and know.” Anyone better apprehends what it is by acquaintance, than I can inform him by description. It is, indeed, a thing so versatile and multiform, appearing in so many shapes, so many postures, so many garbs, so variously apprehended by several eyes and judgements, that it seemeth no less hard to settle a clear and certain notion thereof, than to make a portrait of Proteus, or to define the figure of the fleeting air. Sometimes it lieth in pat allusion to a known story, or in seasonable application of a trivial saying, or in forging an apposite tale; sometimes it playeth in words and phrases, taking advantage from the ambiguity of their sense, or the affinity of their sound: sometimes it is wrapped in a dress of humorous expression: sometimes it lurketh under an odd similitude: sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in a shrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a plausible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute nonsense: sometimes a scenical representation of persons or things, a counterfeit speech, a mimical look or gesture, passeth for it: sometimes an affected simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous bluntness giveth it being: sometimes it riseth only from a lucky hitting upon what is strange: sometimes from a crafty wresting obvious matter to the purpose. Often it consisteth in one knows not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are unaccountable, and inexplicable; being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy, and windings of language. It is, in short, a manner of speaking out of the simple and plain way, (such as reason teacheth and proveth things by,) which by a pretty surprising uncouthness in conceit or expression, doth affect and amuse the fancy, stirring in it some wonder, and breeding some delight thereto. It raiseth admiration, as signifying a nimble sagacity of apprehension, a special felicity of invention, a vivacity of spirit, and reach of wit more than vulgar; it seeming to argue a rare quickness of parts, that one can fetch in remote conceits applicable; a notable skill, that he can dextrously accommodate them to the purpose before him; together with a lively briskness of humour, not apt to damp those sportful flashes of imagination. (Whence in Aristotle such persons are termed [Greek: <i xml:lang="el">hepidexioi</i>], dextrous men, and [Greek: <i xml:lang="el">eustrophoi</i>], men of facile or versatile manners, who can easily turn themselves to all things, or turn all things to themselves.) It also procureth delight, by gratifying curiosity with its rareness, as semblance of difficulty: (as monsters, not for their beauty, but their rarity; as juggling tricks, not for their use, but their abstruseness, are beheld with pleasure:) by diverting the mind from its road of serious thoughts; by instilling gaiety and airiness of spirit; by provoking to such dispositions of spirit in way of emulation or complaisance; and by seasoning matters, otherwise distasteful or insipid, with an unusual and thence grateful tang.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

					<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, being told of a man who was thankful for being introduced to him, “as he had been convinced in a long dispute that an opinion which he had embraced as a settled truth was no better than a vulgar error, ‘Nay,’ said he, ‘do not let him be thankful, for he was right, and I was wrong.’ Like his Uncle Andrew in the ring at Smithfield, Johnson, in a circle of disputants, was determined neither to be thrown nor conquered.” Murphy’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, page 139. Johnson, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Adventurer</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 85, seems to describe his own talk.

					<p>Men of rank and fortune, however, should be pretty well assured of having a real claim to the approbation of the public, as writers, before they venture to stand forth. Dryden, in his preface to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">All for Love</i>, thus expresses himself:⁠—</p>
					<p>“Men of pleasant conversation (at least esteemed so) and endued with a trifling kind of fancy, perhaps helped out by [with] a smattering of Latin, are ambitious to distinguish themselves from the herd of gentlemen, by their poetry:</p>

					<p>And is not this a wretched affectation, not to be contented with what fortune has done for them, and sit down quietly with their estates, but they must call their wits in question, and needlessly expose their nakedness to public view? Not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober men, which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle: If a little glittering in discourse has passed them on us for witty men, where was the necessity of undeceiving the world? Would a man who has an ill title to an estate, but yet is in possession of it, would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at Westminster? We who write, if we want the talents [talent], yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence; but what can be urged in their defence, who, not having the vocation of poverty to scribble, out of mere wantonness take pains to make themselves ridiculous? Horace was certainly in the right where he said, ‘That no man is satisfied with his own condition.’ A poet is not pleased, because he is not rich; and the rich are discontented because the poets will not admit them of their number.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

When these sentences were brought before the House of Commons, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Fox said that it was “the Lord-Advocate’s fervent wish that his native principles of justice should be introduced into this country; and that on the ruins of the common law of England should be erected the infamous fabric of Scottish persecution.⁠ ⁠… If that day should ever arrive, if the tyrannical laws of Scotland should ever be introduced in opposition to the humane laws of England, it would then be high time for my hon. friends and myself to settle our affairs, and retire to some happier clime, where we might at least enjoy those rights which God has given to man, and which his nature tells him he has a right to demand.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parliamentary History</i> xxx. 1563.

					<p>The first of the definitions given by Johnson of <q>to remember</q> is <q>to bear in mind anything; not to forget</q>. <q>To recollect</q> he defines <q>to recover to memory</q>. We may, perhaps, assume that Boswell said, “I did not recollect that the chair was broken;” and that Johnson replied, “you mean, you did not remember. That you did not remember is your own fault. It was in your mind that it was broken, and therefore you ought to have remembered it. It was not a case of recollecting; for we recollect, that is, recover to memory, what is not in our mind.” In the passage <a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-112">here</a>, which begins, “I indeed doubt if he could have remembered,” we find in the first two editions not <em>remembered</em>, but <em>recollected</em>.

					<p>Johnson, no doubt, was leaving Streatham because <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale was leaving it. “Streatham,” wrote Miss Burney, on <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 12 of this year, “my other home, and the place where I have long thought my residence dependent only on my own pleasure, is already let for three years to Lord Shelburne.” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 151. Johnson was not yet leaving the Thrale family, for he joined them at Brighton, and he was living with them the following spring in Argyll-street. Nevertheless, if, as all <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale’s friends strongly held, her second marriage was blameworthy, Boswell’s remark admits of defence. Miss Burney in her diary and letters keeps the secret which <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale had confided to her of her attachment to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Piozzi; but in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney</i>, which, as <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay, she wrote long afterwards, she leaves little doubt that Streatham was given up as a step towards the second marriage. In 1782, on a visit there, she found that her father “and all others⁠—<abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson not excepted⁠—were cast inTo the Same.<!-- recipient -->gulf of general neglect. As <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale became more and more dissatisfied with her own situation, and impatient for its relief, she slighted Johnson’s counsel, and avoided his society.” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay describes a striking scene in which her father, utterly puzzled by “sad and altered Streatham,” left it one day with tears in his eyes. Another day, Johnson accompanied her to London. “His look was stern, though dejected, but when his eye, which, however shortsighted, was quick to mental perception, saw how ill at ease she appeared, all sternness subsided into an undisguised expression of the strongest emotion, while, with a shaking hand and pointing finger, he directed her looks to the mansion from which they were driving; and when they faced it from the coach-window, as they turned into Streatham Common, tremulously exclaimed, ‘That house⁠ ⁠… is lost to <em>me</em>⁠ ⁠… forever.’ ” Johnson’s letter to Langton of March 20, 1782 (<i>ante</i>, page 145), in which he says that he was “musing in his chamber at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale’s,” shows that so early as that date he foresaw that a change was coming.

If it is above their comprehension, there is some gratification, though it is the admiration of ignorance;’ and he said those were the most sincere admirers; and quoted Baxter, who made a rule never to preach a sermon without saying something which he knew was beyond the comprehension of his audience, in order to inspire their admiration.” Taylor’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 456.

All the way up Holborn the crowd was so great, as at every twenty or thirty yards to obstruct the passage; and wine, notwithstanding a late good order against that practice, was brought the malefactors, who drank greedily of it. After this the three thoughtless young men, who at first seemed not enough concerned, grew most shamefully daring and wanton. They swore, laughed, and talked obscenely. At the place of execution the scene grew still more shocking; and the clergyman who attended was more the subject of ridicule than of their serious attention. The psalm was sung amidst the curses and quarrelling of hundreds of the most abandoned and profligate of mankind. As soon as the poor creatures were half-dead, I was much surprised to see the populace fall to haling and pulling the carcases with so much earnestness as to occasion several warm rencounters and broken heads. These, I was told, were the friends of the persons executed, or such as for the sake of tumult chose to appear so; and some persons sent by private surgeons to obtain bodies for dissection.” The psalm is mentioned in a note on the line in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Dunciad</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 4l, “Hence hymning Tyburn’s elegiac lines:”⁠—“It is an ancient English custom,” says Pope, “for the malefactors to sing a psalm at their execution at Tyburn.” <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4822" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>What this period was Boswell seems to leave intentionally vague. Johnson knew Lord Shelburne at least as early as 1778 (<a href="part-3.xhtml#III-page-265">here</a>).

					<p>A writer in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">European Magazine</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXX</span> 160, says that Johnson visited Lord Shelburne at Bowood. At dinner he repeated part of his letter to Lord Chesterfield (<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-261">here</a>). A gentleman arrived late. Shelburne, telling him what he had missed, went on:-“I dare say the Doctor will be kind enough to give it to us again.” “Indeed, my Lord, I will not. I told the circumstance first for my own amusement, but I will not be dragged in as storyteller to a company.” In an argument he used some strong expressions, of which his opponent took no notice, Next morning “he went up to the gentleman with great good-nature, and said, ‘Sir, I have found out upon reflection that I was both warm and wrong in my argument with you last night; for the first of which I beg your pardon, and for the second, I thank you for setting me right.’ ” It is clear that the second of these anecdotes is the same as that told by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Morgann of Johnson and himself, and that the scene has been wrongly transferred from Wickham to Bowood.

					<p>“Sir, Hume is a Tory by chance, as being a Scotchman; but not upon a principle of duty, for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist.” Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Hebrides</i>, <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 30. Horace Walpole’s opinion was very different. “Are not atheism and bigotry first cousins? Was not Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> an atheist and a bigot? and does <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hume pluck a stone from a church but to raise an altar to tyranny?” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 444. Hume wrote in 1756:⁠—“My views of <em>things</em> are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of <em>persons</em> to Tory prejudices.” J.H. Burton’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hume</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 11. Hume’s Toryism increased with years. He says in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Autobiography</i> (page <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xi</span>) that all the alterations which he made in the later editions of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of the Stuarts</i>, “he made invariably to the Tory side.” <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burton gives instances of these; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Hume</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 74. Hume wrote in 1763 that he was “too much infected with the plaguy prejudices of Whiggism when he began the work.” <i>Ib.</i> page 144. In 1770 he wrote:⁠—“I either soften or expunge many villainous, seditious Whig strokes which had crept into it.” <i>Ib.</i> page 434. This growing hatred of Whiggism was, perhaps, due to pique. John Home, in his notes of Hume’s talk in the last weeks of his life, says: “He recurred to a subject not unfrequent with him⁠—that is, the design to ruin him as an author, by the people that were ministers at the first publication of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History</i>, and called themselves Whigs.” <i>Ib.</i> page 500. As regards America, Hume was with the Whigs, as Johnson had perhaps learnt from their common friend, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Strahan. “He was,” says <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burton, “far more tolerant of the sway of individuals over numbers, which he looked upon as the means of preserving order and civilization, than of the predominance of one territory over another, which he looked upon as subjugation.” <i>Ib.</i> page 477. Quite at the beginning of the struggle he foretold that the Americans would not be subdued, unless they broke in pieces among themselves. <i>Ib.</i> page 482. He was not frightened by the prospect of the loss of our supremacy. He wrote to Adam Smith:⁠—“My notion is that the matter is not so important as is commonly imagined. Our navigation and general commerce may suffer more than our manufactures.” <i>Ib.</i> page 484. Johnson’s charge against Hume that he had no principle, is, no doubt, a gross one; yet Hume’s advice to a sceptical young clergyman, who had good hope of preferment, that he should therefore continue in orders, was unprincipled enough. “It is,” he wrote, “putting too great a respect on the vulgar and on their superstitions to pique one’s self on sincerity with regard to them. Did ever one make it a point of honour to speak truth to children or madmen? If the thing were worthy being treated gravely, I should tell him that the Pythian oracle, with the approbation of Xenophon, advised everyone to worship the gods⁠—[Greek: <i xml:lang="el">nomo poleos</i>]. I wish it were still in my power to be a hypocrite in this particular. The common duties of society usually require it; and the ecclesiastical profession only adds a little more to an innocent dissimulation, or rather simulation, without which it is impossible to pass through the world.” <i>Ib.</i> page 187. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-4836" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This was in June, 1783, and I find in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Windham’s private diary (which it seems this conversation induced him to keep) the following memoranda of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s advice: “I have no great timidity in my own disposition, and am no encourager of it in others. Never be afraid to think yourself fit for anything for which your friends think you fit. <em>You will become an able negotiator⁠—a very pretty rascal.</em> No one in Ireland wears even the mask of incorruption; no one professes to do for sixpence what he can get a shilling for doing.

					<p>Northcote (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Reynolds</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 139⁠–⁠143) says that the picture, which was execrable beyond belief, was exhibited in an empty room. Lowe, in 1769 (not in 1771 as Northcote says), gained the gold medal of the Academy for the best historical picture. (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i> 1770, page 587.) Northcote says that the award was not a fair one. He adds that Lowe, being sent to Rome by the patronage of the Academy, was dissatisfied with the sum allowed him. “When Sir Joshua said that he knew from experience that it was sufficient, Lowe pertly answered ‘that it was possible for a man to live on guts and garbage.’ ” He died at an obscure lodging in Westminster, in 1793. There is, wrote Miss Burney, “a certain poor wretch of a villainous painter, one <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lowe, whom <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson recommends to all the people he thinks can afford to sit for their picture. Among these he applied to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crutchley [one of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thrale’s executors]. ‘But now,’ said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Crutchley to me, ‘I have not a notion of sitting for my picture⁠—for who wants it? I may as well give the man the money without; but no, they all said that would not do so well, and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson asked me to give <em>him</em> my picture.’ ‘And I assure you, Sir,’ says he, ‘I shall put it in very good company, for I have portraits of some very respectable people in my dining-room.’ After all I could say I was obliged to go to the painter’s. And I found him in such a condition! a room all dirt and filth, brats squalling and wrangling⁠ ⁠… ‘Oh!’ says I, ‘<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lowe, I beg your pardon for running away, but I have just recollected another engagement; so I poked three guineas in his hand, and told him I would come again another time, and then ran out of the house with all my might.’ ” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 41.

By a committee consisting of Milman, Thackeray, Dickens, Carlyle and others, an annuity fund for her and her sister was raised.

In my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</i>, 3 <abbr>ed.</abbr> page 386 [page 366, <abbr>Oct.</abbr> 24], it appears that he made this frank confession:⁠—“Nobody at times, talks more laxly than I do;” and, <i>ib.</i> page 231 [<abbr>Sept.</abbr> 19, 1773], “He fairly owned he could not explain the rationality of duelling.” We may, therefore, infer, that he could not think that justifiable, which seems so inconsistent with the spirit of the Gospel. At the same time it must be confessed, that from the prevalent notions of honour, a gentleman who receives a challenge is reduced to a dreadful alternative.

Where the deceased is really spoken of, the expression is very different, ‘as our hope is this our brother doth’ [rest in Christ]; a mode of speech consistent with everything but absolute certainty that the person departed doth <em>not</em> rest in Christ, which no one can be assured of, without immediate revelation from Heaven.

The chemical philosophers have discovered a body (which I have forgotten, but will enquire) which, dissolved by an acid, emits a vapour lighter than the atmospherical air. This vapour is caught, among other means, by tying a bladder compressed upon the body in which the dissolution is performed; the vapour rising swells the bladder and fills it. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 310.

					<p>I do not wonder at Johnson’s displeasure when the name of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Priestley was mentioned; for I know no writer who has been suffered to publish more pernicious doctrines. I shall instance only three. First, <em>Materialism</em>; by which <em>mind</em> is denied to human nature; which, if believed, must deprive us of every elevated principle. Secondly, <em>Necessity</em>; or the doctrine that every action, whether good or bad, is included in an unchangeable and unavoidable system; a notion utterly subversive of moral government. Thirdly, that we have no reason to think that the <em>future</em> world, (which, as he is pleased to <em>inform</em> us, will be adapted to our <em>merely improved</em> nature,) will be materially different from <em>this</em>; which, if believed, would sink wretched mortals into despair, as they could no longer hope for the “rest that remaineth for the people of <b>God</b>” [Hebrews, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 9], or for that happiness which is revealed to us as something beyond our present conceptions; but would feel themselves doomed to a continuation of the uneasy state under which they now groan. I say nothing of the petulant intemperance with which he dares to insult the venerable establishments of his country.</p>
					<p>As a specimen of his writings, I shall quote the following passage, which appears to me equally absurd and impious, and which might have been retorted upon him by the men who were prosecuted for burning his house. “I cannot, (says he,) as a <em>necessarian</em>, [meaning <em>necessitarian</em>] hate <em>any man</em>; because I consider him as <em>being</em>, in all respects, just what <b>God</b> has <em>made him to be</em>; and also as <em>doing with respect to me</em>, nothing but what he was <em>expressly designed</em> and <em>appointed</em> to do; <b>God</b> being the <em>only cause</em>, and men nothing more than the <em>instruments</em> in his hands to <em>execute all his pleasure</em>.”⁠— <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Illustrations of Philosophical Necessity</i>, page 111.</p>
					<p>The Reverend <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Parr, in a late tract, appears to suppose that “<em><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson not only endured, but almost solicited, an interview with <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Priestley.</em> In justice to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, I declare my firm belief that he never did. My illustrious friend was particularly resolute in not giving countenance to men whose writings he considered as pernicious to society. I was present at Oxford when <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Price, even before he had rendered himself so generally obnoxious by his zeal for the French Revolution, came into a company where Johnson was, who instantly left the room. Much more would he have reprobated <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Priestley. Whoever wishes to see a perfect delineation of this <em>Literary Jack of all Trades</em>, may find it in an ingenious tract, entitled, “<i epub:type="se:name.publication.pamphlet">A Small Whole-Length of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Priestley</i>,” printed for Rivingtons, in <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s Churchyard. <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

Thus Empires are broken down when the profits of administration are so great, that ambition is satisfied with obtaining them, and he that aspires to greatness needs do nothing more than talk himself into importance. He has then all the power which danger and conquest used formerly to give; he can raise a family and reward his followers.</p>

					<p>After all, I cannot but be of opinion, that as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton was seriously requested by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson to mention what appeared to him erroneous in the character of his friend, he was bound, as an honest man, to intimate what he really thought, which he certainly did in the most delicate manner; so that Johnson himself, when in a quiet frame of mind, was pleased with it. The texts suggested are now before me, and I shall quote a few of them. “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” <i>Mat.</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 5.⁠—“I therefore, the prisoner of the LORD, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called; with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love.” <i>Ephes.</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> [<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>] 1, 2.⁠—“And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.” <abbr>Col.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 14.⁠—“Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up: doth not behave itself unseemly, is not easily provoked.” 1 <i>Cor.</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> 4, 5. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Johnson, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Rambler</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 28, had almost foretold what would happen. “For escaping these and a thousand other deceits many expedients have been proposed. Some have recommended the frequent consultation of a wise friend, admitted to intimacy and encouraged by sincerity. But this appears a remedy by no means adapted to general use; for, in order to secure the virtue of one, it presupposes more virtue in two than will generally be found. In the first, such a desire of rectitude and amendment as may incline him to hear his own accusation from the mouth of him whom he esteems, and by whom therefore he will always hope that his faults are not discovered; and in the second, such zeal and honesty as will make him content for his friend’s advantage to lose his kindness.” <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5097" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

His reputation was so high in the republic of letters, that it wanted not to be raised upon the ruins of others.

					<p>The <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Agutter [<i>post</i>, under <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 20] has favoured me with a note of a dialogue between <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Henderson [<i>post</i>, June 12] and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson on this topic, as related by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Henderson, and it is evidently so authentic that I shall here insert it:⁠—<b epub:type="z3998:surname">Henderson</b><b epub:type="z3998:surname">Henderson</b>. “What do you think, Sir, of William Law?” <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Johnson</b>. “William Law, Sir, wrote the best piece of Parenetic Divinity; but William Law was no reasoner.” <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Henderson</b>. “Jeremy Collier, Sir?” <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Johnson</b>. “Jeremy Collier fought without a rival, and therefore could not claim the victory.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Henderson mentioned Kenn and Kettlewell; but some objections were made: at last he said, “But, Sir, what do you think of Leslie?” <b epub:type="z3998:surname">Johnson</b>. “Charles Leslie I had forgotten. Leslie <em>was</em> a reasoner, and <em>a reasoner who was not to be reasoned against</em>.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>.</p>
					<p>For the effect of Law’s “Parenetic Divinity” on Johnson, see <a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-68">here</a>. “I am surprised,” writes Macaulay, “that Johnson should have pronounced Law no reasoner. Law did indeed fall into great errors; but they were errors against which logic affords no security. In mere dialectical skill he had very few superiors.” Macaulay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">England</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1874, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 81, note.

Dryden’s conscience, or his prudence, angry as he was, withheld him from the conflict: Congreve and Vanbrugh attempted answers.” Of Leslie, Lord Bolingbroke thus writes (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, in. 45):⁠—“Let neither the polemical skill of Leslie, nor the antique erudition of Bedford, persuade us to put on again those old shackles of false law, false reason, and false gospel, which were forged before the Revolution, and broken to pieces by it.” Leslie is described by Macaulay, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of England</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 81. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5113" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The sermon thus opens:⁠—“That there are angels and spirits good and bad; that at the head of these last there is <b>one</b> more considerable and malignant than the rest, who, in the form, or under the name of a <em>serpent</em>, was deeply concerned in the fall of man, and whose <em>head</em>, as the prophetic language is, the son of man was one day to <em>bruise</em>; that this evil spirit, though that prophecy be in part completed, has not yet received his death’s wound, but is still permitted, for ends unsearchable to us, and in ways which we cannot particularly explain, to have a certain degree of power in this world hostile to its virtue and happiness, and sometimes exerted with too much success; all this is so clear from Scripture, that no believer, unless he be first of all <em>spoiled by philosophy and vain deceit</em> [Colossians, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 8], can possibly entertain a doubt of it.”</p>
					<p>Having treated of <em>possessions</em>, his Lordship says, “As I have no authority to affirm that there <em>are</em> now any such, so neither may I presume to say with confidence, that there are <em>not</em> any.”</p>
					<p>“But then with regard to the influence of evil spirits at this day upon the <b>souls</b> of men, I shall take leave to be a great deal more peremptory.⁠—(Then, having stated the various proofs, he adds,) All this, I say, is so manifest to everyone who reads the Scriptures, that, if we respect their authority, the question concerning the reality of the demoniack influence upon the minds of men is clearly determined.”</p>
					<p>Let it be remembered, that these are not the words of an antiquated or obscure enthusiast, but of a learned and polite Prelate now alive; and were spoken, not to a vulgar congregation, but to the Honourable Society of Lincoln’s-Inn. His Lordship in this sermon explains the words, “deliver us from evil,” in the Lord’s Prayer, as signifying a request to be protected from “the evil one,” that is the Devil. This is well illustrated in a short but excellent Commentary by my late worthy friend, the Reverend <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Lort, of whom it may truly be said, <i xml:lang="la">Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit.</i> It is remarkable that Waller, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Reflections on the several Petitions, in that sacred form of devotion</i>, has understood this in the same sense;⁠—</p>
					<p>“Guard us from all temptations of the <b>Foe</b>.”</p>

					<p>The Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ralph Churton, Fellow of Brazen-Nose College, Oxford, has favoured me with the following remarks on my Work, which he is pleased to say, “I have hitherto extolled, and cordially approve.”</p>
					<p>“The chief part of what I have to observe is contained in the following transcript from a letter to a friend, which, with his concurrence, I copied for this purpose; and, whatever may be the merit or justness of the remarks, you may be sure that being written to a most intimate friend, without any intention that they ever should go further, they are the genuine and undisguised sentiments of the writer:⁠—</p>
					<p>“<abbr>Jan.</abbr> 6, 1792.</p>
					<p>“Last week, I was reading the second volume of Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, with increasing esteem for the worthy author, and increasing veneration of the wonderful and excellent man who is the subject of it. The writer throws in, now and then, very properly some serious religious reflections; but there is one remark, in my mind an obvious and just one, which I think he has not made, that Johnson’s ‘morbid melancholy,’ and constitutional infirmities, were intended by Providence, like <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s thorn in the flesh, to check intellectual conceit and arrogance; which the consciousness of his extraordinary talents, awake as he was to the voice of praise, might otherwise have generated in a very culpable degree. Another observation strikes me, that in consequence of the same natural indisposition, and habitual sickliness, (for he says he scarcely passed one day without pain after his twentieth year,) he considered and represented human life, as a scene of much greater misery than is generally experienced. There may be persons bowed down with affliction all their days; and there are those, no doubt, whose iniquities rob them of rest; but neither calamities nor crimes, I hope and believe, do so much and so generally abound, as to justify the dark picture of life which Johnson’s imagination designed, and his strong pencil delineated. This I am sure, the colouring is far too gloomy for what I have experienced, though as far as I can remember, I have had more sickness (I do not say more severe, but only more in quantity,) than falls to the lot of most people. But then daily debility and occasional sickness were far overbalanced by intervenient days, and, perhaps, weeks void of pain, and overflowing with comfort. So that in short, to return to the subject, human life, as far as I can perceive from experience or observation, is not that state of constant wretchedness which Johnson always insisted it was; which misrepresentation, (for such it surely is,) his Biographer has not corrected, I suppose, because, unhappily, he has himself a large portion of melancholy in his constitution, and fancied the portrait a faithful copy of life.”</p>
					<p>The learned writer then proceeds thus in his letter to me:⁠—</p>
					<p>“I have conversed with some sensible men on this subject, who all seem to entertain the same sentiments respecting life with those which are expressed or implied in the foregoing paragraph. It might be added that as the representation here spoken of, appears not consistent with fact and experience, so neither does it seem to be countenanced by Scripture. There is, perhaps, no part of the sacred volume which at first sight promises so much to lend its sanction to these dark and desponding notions as the book of Ecclesiastes, which so often, and so emphatically, proclaims the vanity of things sublunary. But the design of this whole book, (as it has been justly observed,) is not to put us out of conceit with life, but to cure our vain expectations of a complete and perfect happiness in this world; to convince us, that there is no such thing to be found in mere external enjoyments;⁠—and to teach us to seek for happiness in the practice of virtue, in the knowledge and love of God, and in the hopes of a better life. For this is the application of all; <em>Let us hear</em>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> 13. Not only his duty, but his happiness too; _For_ <b>God</b>, <abbr>etc.</abbr> ver. 14.⁠—See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sherlock on Providence</i>, page 299.</p>
					<p>“The New Testament tells us, indeed, and most truly, that ‘sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof;’ and, therefore, wisely forbids us to increase our burden by forebodings of sorrows; but I think it nowhere says that even our ordinary afflictions are not consistent with a very considerable degree of positive comfort and satisfaction. And, accordingly, one whose sufferings as well as merits were conspicuous, assures us, that in proportion ‘as the sufferings of Christ abounded in them, so their consolation also abounded by Christ.’ 2 Cor. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 5. It is needless to cite, as indeed it would be endless even to refer to, the multitude of passages in both Testaments holding out, in the strongest language, promises of blessings, even in this world, to the faithful servants of <b>God</b>. I will only refer to <abbr>St.</abbr> Luke, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span> 29, 30, and 1 Tim. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 8.</p>
					<p>“Upon the whole, setting aside instances of great and lasting bodily pain, of minds peculiarly oppressed by melancholy, and of severe temporal calamities, from which extraordinary cases we surely should not form our estimate of the general tenour and complexion of life; excluding these from the account, I am convinced that as well the gracious constitution of things which Providence has ordained, as the declarations of Scripture and the actual experience of individuals, authorize the sincere Christian to hope that his humble and constant endeavours to perform his duty, checquered as the best life is with many failings, will be crowned with a greater degree of present peace, serenity, and comfort, than he could reasonably permit himself to expect, if he measured his views and judged of life from the opinion of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, often and energetically expressed in the Memoirs of him, without any animadversion or censure by his ingenious Biographer. If he himself, upon reviewing the subject, shall see the matter in this light, he will, in an octavo edition, which is eagerly expected, make such additional remarks or correction as he shall judge fit; lest the impressions which these discouraging passages may leave on the reader’s mind, should in any degree hinder what otherwise the whole spirit and energy of the work tends, and, I hope, successfully, to promote⁠—pure morality and true religion.”</p>
					<p>Though I have, in some degree, obviated any reflections against my illustrious friend’s dark views of life, when considering, in the course of this Work, his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Rambler</i> [<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-213">here</a>] and his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rasselas</i> [<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-343">here</a>], I am obliged to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Churton for complying with my request of his permission to insert his Remarks, being conscious of the weight of what he judiciously suggests as to the melancholy in my own constitution. His more pleasing views of life, I hope, are just. <i xml:lang="la">Valeant quantum valere possunt.</i></p>
					<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Churton concludes his letter to me in these words:⁠—“Once, and only once, I had the satisfaction of seeing your illustrious friend; and as I feel a particular regard for all whom he distinguished with his esteem and friendship, so I derive much pleasure from reflecting that I once beheld, though but transiently near our College gate, one whose works will forever delight and improve the world, who was a sincere and zealous son of the Church of England, an honour to his country, and an ornament to human nature.”</p>
					<p>His letter was accompanied with a present from himself of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sermons at the Bampton Lecture</i>, and from his friend, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Townson, the venerable Rector of Malpas, in Cheshire, of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Discourses on the Gospels</i>, together with the following extract of a letter from that excellent person, who is now gone to receive the reward of his labours:⁠—“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Boswell is not only very entertaining in his works, but they are so replete with moral and religious sentiments, without an instance, as far as I know, of a contrary tendency, that I cannot help having a great esteem for him; and if you think such a trifle as a copy of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Discourses</i>, <i xml:lang="la">ex dono authoris</i>, would be acceptable to him, I should be happy to give him this small testimony of my regard.”</p>
					<p>Such spontaneous testimonies of approbation from such men, without any personal acquaintance with me, are truly valuable and encouraging.</p>

					<p>She first saw Johnson in June, 1774. According to her <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoirs</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 48) he met her “with good humour in his countenance, and continued in the same pleasant humour the whole of the evening.” She called on him in Bolt Court. One of her sisters writes:⁠—“Miss Reynolds told the doctor of all our rapturous exclamations [about him] on the road. He shook his scientific head at Hannah, and said, ‘She was a silly thing.’ ” <i>Ib.</i> page 49. “He afterwards mentioned to Miss Reynolds how much he had been touched with the enthusiasm of the young authoress, which was evidently genuine and unaffected.” <i>Ib.</i> page 50. She met him again in the spring of 1775. Her sister writes:⁠—“The old genius was extremely jocular, and the young one very pleasant. They indeed tried which could ‘pepper the highest’ [Goldsmith’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Retaliation</i>], and it is not clear to me that he was really the highest seasoner.” <i>Ib.</i> page 54. From the Mores we know nothing of his reproof. He had himself said of “a literary lady’⁠—no doubt Hannah More⁠—“I was obliged to speak to Miss Reynolds to let her know that I desired she would not flatter me so much.” See <a href="part-3.xhtml#III-page-293">here</a>. Miss Burney records a story she had from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale, “which,” she continues, “exceeds, I think, in its severity all the severe things I have yet heard of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson’s saying. When Miss More was introduced to him, she began singing his praise in the warmest manner. For some time he heard her with that quietness which a long use of praise has given him: she then redoubled her strokes, till at length he turned suddenly to her, with a stern and angry countenance, and said, ‘Madam, before you flatter a man so grossly to his face, you should consider whether or not your flattery is worth his having.’ ” <abbr>Mme.</abbr> D’Arblay’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diary</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 103. Shortly afterwards Miss Burney records (<i>ib.</i> page 121) that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale said to him:⁠—“We have told her what you said to Miss More, and I believe that makes her afraid.” He replied:⁠—“Well, and if she was to serve me as Miss More did, I should say the same thing to her.” We have therefore three reports of what he said⁠—one from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Thrale indirectly, one from her directly, and the third from Malone. However severe the reproof was, the Mores do not seem to have been much touched by it. At all events they enjoyed the meeting with Johnson, and Hannah More needed a second reproof that was conveyed to her through Miss Reynolds. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5284" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Scarcely had Pitt obtained possession of unbounded power when an aged writer of the highest eminence, who had made very little by his writings, and who was sinking into the grave under a load of infirmities and sorrows, wanted five or six hundred pounds to enable him, during the winter or two which might still remain to him, to draw his breath more easily in the soft climate of Italy. Not a farthing was to be obtained; and before Christmas the author of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">English Dictionary</i> and of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Poets</i> had gasped his last in the river fog and coal smoke of Fleet-street.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Macaulay’s Writings and Speeches</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1871, page 413. Just before Macaulay, with monstrous exaggeration, says that Gibbon, “forced by poverty to leave his country, completed his immortal work on the shores of Lake Leman.” This poverty of Gibbon would have been “splendour” to Johnson. Debrett’s Royal Kalendar, for 1795 (page 88), shows that there were twelve Lords of the King’s Bedchamber receiving each £1000 a year, and fourteen Grooms of the Bedchamber receiving each, £500 a year. As Burns was made a gauger, so Johnson might have been made a Lord, or at least a Groom of the Bedchamber. It is not certain that Pitt heard of the application for an increased pension. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker quotes from Thurlow’s letter to Reynolds of <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 18, 1784:⁠—“It was impossible for me to take the King’s pleasure on the suggestion I presumed to move. I am an untoward solicitor.” Whether he consulted Pitt cannot be known. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker notices a curious obliteration in this letter. The Chancellor had written:⁠—“It would have suited the purpose better, if nobody had heard of it, except <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, you and J. Boswell.” <q>Boswell</q> has been erased⁠—“artfully” too, says⁠—<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker-so that “the sentence appears to run, ‘except <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, you, and I.’ ” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker, with his usual suspiciousness, suspects “an uncandid trick.” But it is very likely that Thurlow himself made the obliteration, regardless of grammar. He might easily have thought that it would have been better still had Boswell not been in the secret. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5311" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>There was no information for which <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson was less grateful that than for that which concerned the weather. It was in allusion to his impatience with those who were reduced to keep conversation alive by observations on the weather, that he applied the old proverb to himself. If anyone of his intimate acquaintance told him it was hot or cold, wet or dry, windy or calm, he would stop them, by saying, “Poh! poh! you are telling us that of which none but men in a mine or a dungeon can be ignorant. Let us bear with patience, or enjoy in quiet, elementary changes, whether for the better or the worse, as they are never secrets.” <cite>—Burney</cite>. In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Idler</i>, No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, Johnson shows that “an Englishman’s notice of the weather is the natural consequence of changeable skies and uncertain seasons⁠ ⁠… In our island every man goes to sleep unable to guess whether he shall behold in the morning a bright or cloudy atmosphere, whether his rest shall be lulled by a shower, or broken by a tempest.

					<p>The Duke of Devonshire has kindly given me the following explanation of this term:⁠—“It was formerly the custom at some (I believe several) of the large country-houses to have dinners at which any of the neighbouring gentry and clergy might present themselves as guests without invitation. The custom had been discontinued at Chatsworth before my recollection, and so far as I am aware is now only kept-up at Wentworth, Lord Fitzwilliam’s house in Yorkshire, where a few public dinners are still given annually. I believe, however, that all persons intending to be present on such occasions are now expected to give notice some days previously. Public dinners were also given formerly by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and if I am not mistaken also by the Archbishop of York. I have myself been present at a public dinner at Lambeth Palace within the last fifty years or thereabouts, and I have been at one or more such dinners at Wentworth.” Since receiving this explanation I have read the following in the second part of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Greville Memoirs</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 99:⁠—“June 1, 1838.

					<p>I shall add one instance only to those which I have thought it incumbent on me to point out. Talking of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Garrick’s having signified his willingness to let Johnson have the loan of any of his books to assist him in his edition of Shakespeare [<a href="part-2.xhtml#II-page-192">here</a>]; Sir John says, (page 444,) “<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Garrick knew not what risque he ran by this offer. Johnson had so strange a forgetfulness of obligations of this sort, that few who lent him books ever saw them again.” This surely conveys a most unfavourable insinuation, and has been so understood. Sir John mentions the single case of a curious edition of Politian [<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-90">here</a>], which he tells us, “appeared to belong to Pembroke College, and which, probably, had been considered by Johnson as his own, for upwards of fifty years.” Would it not be fairer to consider this as an inadvertence, and draw no general inference? The truth is, that Johnson was so attentive, that in one of his manuscripts in my possession, he has marked in two columns, books borrowed, and books lent.</p>
					<p>In Sir John Hawkins’s compilation, there are, however, some passages concerning Johnson which have unquestionable merit. One of them I shall transcribe, in justice to a writer whom I have had too much occasion to censure, and to show my fairness as the biographer of my illustrious friend: “There was wanting in his conduct and behaviour, that dignity which results from a regular and orderly course of action, and by an irresistible power commands esteem. He could not be said to be a stayed man, nor so to have adjusted in his mind the balance of reason and passion, as to give occasion to say what may be observed of some men, that all they do is just, fit, and right.” [Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Johnson</i>, page 409.] Yet a judicious friend well suggests, “It might, however, have been added, that such men are often merely just, and rigidly correct, while their hearts are cold and unfeeling; and that Johnson’s virtues were of a much higher tone than those of the <em>stayed, orderly man</em>, here described.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5375" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Coluthus, to be translated.</p>
					<p>“Prejudice⁠—a poetical essay.</p>
					<p>“The Palace of Nonsense⁠—a vision.”</p>
					<p>Johnson’s extraordinary facility of composition, when he shook off his constitutional indolence, and resolutely sat down to write, is admirably described by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Courtenay, in his Poetical Review, which I have several times quoted:</p>
					<p>“While through life's maze he sent a piercing view, His mind expansive to the object grew. With various stores of erudition fraught, The lively image, the deep-searching thought, Slept in repose;⁠—but when the moment press'd, The bright ideas stood at once confess'd; Instant his genius sped its vigorous rays, And o'er the letter'd world diffus'd a blaze: As womb'd with fire the cloud electric flies, And calmly o'er th' horizon seems to rise; Touch'd by the pointed steel, the lightning flows, And all th' expanse with rich effulgence glows.”</p>
					<p>We shall in vain endeavour to know with exact precision every production of Johnson’s pen. He owned to me, that he had written about forty sermons; but as I understood that he had given or sold them to different persons, who were to preach them as their own, he did not consider himself at liberty to acknowledge them. Would those who were thus aided by him, who are still alive, and the friends of those who are dead, fairly inform the world, it would be obligingly gratifying a reasonable curiosity, to which there should, I think, now be no objection. Two volumes of them, published since his death, are sufficiently ascertained; see volume <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> page 181. I have before me, in his handwriting, a fragment of twenty quarto leaves, of a translation into English of Sallust, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">De Bella Catilinario</i>. When it was done I have no notion; but it seems to have no very superior merit to mark it as his. Beside the publications heretofore mentioned, I am satisfied, from internal evidence, to admit also as genuine the following, which, notwithstanding all my chronological care, escaped me in the course of this work:</p>
					<p>“Considerations on the Case of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Trapp’s Sermons,” published in 1739, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Gentleman’s Magazine</i>. [These Considerations were published, not in 1739, but in 1787. See <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-400">this note</a>.] It is a very ingenious defence of the right of <em>abridging</em> an author’s work, without being held as infringing his property. This is one of the nicest questions in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Law of Literature</i>; and I cannot help thinking, that the indulgence of abridging is often exceedingly injurious to authors and booksellers, and should in very few cases be permitted. At any rate, to prevent difficult and uncertain discussion, and give an absolute security to authors in the property of their labours, no abridgement whatever should be permitted, till after the expiration of such a number of years as the Legislature may be pleased to fix.</p>
					<p>But, though it has been confidently ascribed to him, I cannot allow that he wrote a Dedication to both Houses of Parliament of a book entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Evangelical History Harmonized</i>. He was no <em>croaker</em>; no declaimer against <em>the times</em>. [See <a href="part-2.xhtml#II-page-357">here</a>.] He would not have written, “That we are fallen upon an age in which corruption is not barely universal, is universally confessed.” Nor “Rapine preys on the public without opposition, and perjury betrays it without inquiry.” Nor would he, to excite a speedy reformation, have conjured up such phantoms of terror as these: “A few years longer, and perhaps all endeavours will be in vain. We may be swallowed by an earthquake: we may be delivered to our enemies.” This is not Johnsonian.</p>
					<p>There are, indeed, in this Dedication, several sentences constructed upon the model of those of Johnson. But the imitation of the form, without the spirit of his style, has been so general, that this of itself is not sufficient evidence. Even our newspaper writers aspire to it. In an account of the funeral of Edwin, the comedian, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Diary</i> of <abbr>Nov.</abbr> 9, 1790, that son of drollery is thus described: “A man who had so often cheered the sullenness of vacancy, and suspended the approaches of sorrow.” And in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Dublin Evening Post</i>, August 16, 1791, there is the following paragraph: “It is a singular circumstance, that, in a city like this, containing 200,000 people, there are three months in the year during which no place of public amusement is open. Long vacation is here a vacation from pleasure, as well as business; nor is there any mode of passing the listless evenings of declining summer, but in the riots of a tavern, or the stupidity of a coffeehouse.”</p>
					<p>I have not thought it necessary to specify every copy of verses written by Johnson, it being my intention to, publish an authentic edition of all his Poetry, with notes. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. This “Catalogue”, as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Boswell calls it, is by <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson intitled “Designs”. It seems from the hand that it was written early in life: from the marginal dates it appears that some portions were added in 1752 and 1753. <cite>—Croker</cite>. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5399" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>It is entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">A Continuation of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> J⁠—n’s Criticism on the Poems of Gray</i>. The following is perhaps the best passage:⁠—“On some fine evening Gray had seen the moon shining on a tower such as is here described. An owl might be peeping out from the ivy with which it was clad. Of the observer the station might be such that the owl, now emerged from the mantling, presented itself to his eye in profile, skirting with the Moon’s limb. All this is well. The perspective is striking; and the picture well defined. But the poet was not contented. He felt a desire to enlarge it; and in executing his purpose gave it accumulation without improvement. The idea of the Owl’s <em>complaining</em> is an artificial one; and the views on which it proceeds absurd. Gray should have seen, that it but ill befitted the <em>Bird of Wisdom</em> to complain to the Moon of an intrusion which the Moon could no more help than herself.” page 17. Johnson wrote of this book:⁠—“I know little of it, for though it was sent me I never cut the leaves open. I had a letter with it representing it to me as my own work; in such an account to the public there may be humour, but to myself it was neither serious nor comical. I suspect the writer to be wrongheaded.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Piozzi Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 289. “I was told,” wrote Walpole (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 376), “it would divert me, that it seems to criticise Gray, but really laughs at Johnson. I sent for it and skimmed it over, but am not at all clear what it means⁠—no recommendation of anything. I rather think the author wishes to be taken by Gray’s admirers for a ridiculer of Johnson, and by the tatter’s for a censurer of Gray.” “ ‘The cleverest parody of the Doctor’s style of criticism,’ wrote Sir Walter Scott, ‘is by John Young of Glasgow, and is very capital.’ ” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Croker Correspondence</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 34. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5422" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This bold experiment, Sir John Hawkins has related in such a manner as to suggest a charge against Johnson of intentionally hastening his end; a charge so very inconsistent with his character in every respect, that it is injurious even to refute it, as Sir John has thought it necessary to do.

I give and bequeath to the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rogers, of Berkley, near Froom, in the county of Somerset, the sum of one hundred pounds, requesting him to apply the same towards the maintenance of Elizabeth Herne, a lunatic [F-2].

And whereas the said Bennet Langton hath agreed, in consideration of the sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds, mentioned in my Will to be in his hands, to grant and secure an annuity of seventy pounds payable during the life of me and my servant, Francis Barber, and the life of the survivor of us, to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George Stubbs, in trust for us; my mind and will is, that in case of my decease before the said agreement shall be perfected, the said sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds, and the bond for securing the said sum, shall go to the said Francis Barber; and I hereby give and bequeath to him the same, in lieu of the bequest in his favour, contained in my said Will. And I hereby empower my Executors to deduct and retain all expenses that shall or may be incurred in the execution of my said Will, or of this Codicil thereto, out of such estate and effects as I shall die possessed of. All the rest, residue, and remainder, of my estate and effects, I give and bequeath to my said Executors, in trust for the said Francis Barber, his Executors and Administrators. Witness my hand and seal, this ninth day of December, 1784.</p>
					<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Sam.</abbr> Johnson, (L. S.)</p>
					<p>“Signed, sealed, published, declared, and delivered, by the said Samuel Johnson, as, and for a Codicil to his last Will and Testament, in the presence of us, who, in his presence, and at his request, and also in the presence of each other, have hereto subscribed our names as witnesses. <span epub:type="z3998:signature">John Copley</span>. <span epub:type="z3998:signature">William Gibson</span>. <span epub:type="z3998:signature">Henry Cole</span>.”</p>
					<p>Upon these testamentary deeds it is proper to make a few observations.</p>
					<p>His express declaration with his dying breath as a Christian, as it had been often practised in such solemn writings, was of real consequence from this great man; for the conviction of a mind equally acute and strong, might well overbalance the doubts of others, who were his contemporaries. The expression <em>polluted</em>, may, to some, convey an impression of more than ordinary contamination; but that is not warranted by its genuine meaning, as appears from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">The Rambler</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 42[F-8]. The same word is used in the will of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Sanderson, Bishop of Lincoln [F-9], who was piety itself.</p>
					<p>His legacy of two hundred pounds to the representatives of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Innys, bookseller, in <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s Churchyard [F-10], proceeded from a very worthy motive. He told Sir John Hawkins, that his father having become a bankrupt, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Innys had assisted him with money or credit to continue his business. “This, (said he,) I consider as an obligation on me to be grateful to his descendants [F-11].”</p>
					<p>The amount of his property proved to be considerably more than he had supposed it to be. Sir John Hawkins estimates the bequest to Francis Barber at a sum little short of fifteen hundred pounds, including an annuity of seventy pounds to be paid to him by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton, in consideration of seven hundred and fifty pounds, which Johnson had lent to that gentleman. Sir John seems not a little angry at this bequest, and mutters “a caveat against ostentatious bounty and favour to negroes [F-12].” But surely when a man has money entirely of his own acquisition, especially when he has no near relations, he may, without blame, dispose of it as he pleases, and with great propriety to a faithful servant. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Barber, by the recommendation of his master, retired to Lichfield, where he might pass the rest of his days in comfort.</p>
					<p>It has been objected that Johnson has omitted many of his best friends, when leaving books to several as tokens of his last remembrance. The names of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Adams, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Taylor [F-13], <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hector, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murphy, the Author of this Work, and others who were intimate with him, are not to be found in his Will. This may be accounted for by considering, that as he was very near his dissolution at the time, he probably mentioned such as happened to occur to him; and that he may have recollected, that he had formerly shown others such proofs of his regard, that it was not necessary to crowd his Will with their names. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lucy Porter was much displeased that nothing was left to her; but besides what I have now stated, she should have considered, that she had left nothing to Johnson by her Will, which was made during his lifetime, as appeared at her decease.</p>
					<p>His enumerating several persons in one group, and leaving them “each a book at their election,” might possibly have given occasion to a curious question as to the order of choice, had they not luckily fixed on different books. His library, though by no means handsome in its appearance, was sold by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Christie, for two hundred and forty-seven pounds, nine shillings [F-14]; many people being desirous to have a book which had belonged to Johnson. In many of them he had written little notes: sometimes tender memorials of his departed wife; as, “This was dear Tetty’s book:” sometimes occasional remarks of different sorts. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lysons, of Clifford’s Inn, has favoured me with the two following:</p>

He mentions (<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-27">here</a>) that these “few fragments’ had been transferred to him by the residuary legatee (Francis Barber).

					<p>One of these volumes, Sir John Hawkins informs us, he put into his pocket; for which the excuse he states is, that he meant to preserve it from falling into the hands of a person whom he describes so as to make it sufficiently clear who is meant; “having strong reasons (said he,) to suspect that this man might find and make an ill use of the book.” Why Sir John should suppose that the gentleman alluded to would act in this manner, he has not thought fit to explain. But what he did was not approved of by Johnson; who, upon being acquainted of it without delay by a friend, expressed great indignation, and warmly insisted on the book being delivered up; and, afterwards, in the supposition of his missing it, without knowing by whom it had been taken, he said, “Sir, I should have gone out of the world distrusting half mankind.” Sir John next day wrote a letter to Johnson, assigning reasons for his conduct; upon which Johnson observed to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton, “Bishop Sanderson could not have dictated a better letter. I could almost say, <i xml:lang="la">Melius est sic penituisse quam non errâsse</i>.” The agitation into which Johnson was thrown by this incident, probably made him hastily burn those precious records which must ever be regretted. <cite>—Boswell</cite>. According to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Croker, Steevens was the man whom Hawkins said that he suspected. Porson, in his witty “Panegyrical Epistle on Hawkins <abbr>v.</abbr> Johnson” (<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> 1787, pages 751⁠–⁠3, and <i>Porson Tracts</i>, page 341), says:⁠—“I shall attempt a translation [of <i xml:lang="la">Melius est</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>] for the benefit of your mere English readers:⁠—<q>There is more joy over a sinner that repenteth than over a just person that needeth no repentance</q>.

					<p>On the same undoubted authority, I give a few articles, which should have been inserted in chronological order; but which, now that they are before me, I should be sorry to omit:⁠—</p>
					<p>“In 1736, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson had a particular inclination to have been engaged as an assistant To the Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Budworth, then head master of the Grammar-school, at Brewood, in Staffordshire, ‘an excellent person, who possessed every talent of a perfect instructor of youth, in a degree which, (to use the words of one of the brightest ornaments of literature, the Reverend <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Hurd, Bishop of Worcester,) has been rarely found in any of that profession since the days of Quintilian.’ <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Budworth, ‘who was less known in his lifetime, from that obscure situation to which the caprice of fortune oft condemns the most accomplished characters, than his highest merit deserved,’ had been bred under <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blackwell [Blackwall], at Market Bosworth, where Johnson was some time an usher [<a href="part-1.xhtml#I-page-84">here</a>]; which might naturally lead to the application. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Budworth was certainly no stranger to the learning or abilities of Johnson; as he more than once lamented his having been under the necessity of declining the engagement, from an apprehension that the paralytic affection, under which our great Philologist laboured through life, might become the object of imitation or of ridicule, among his pupils.” Captain Budworth, his grandson, has confirmed to me this anecdote.</p>
					<p>“Among the early associates of Johnson, at <abbr>St.</abbr> John’s Gate, was Samuel Boyse [G-1], well known by his ingenious productions; and not less noted for his imprudence. It was not unusual for Boyse to be a customer to the pawnbroker. On one of these occasions, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson collected a sum of money to redeem his friend’s clothes, which in two days after were pawned again. ‘The sum, (said Johnson,) was collected by sixpences, at a time when to me sixpence was a serious consideration [G-2].’</p>
					<p>“Speaking one day of a person for whom he had a real friendship, but in whom vanity was somewhat too predominant, he observed, that ‘Kelly [G-3] was so fond of displaying on his sideboard the plate which he possessed, that he added to it his spurs. For my part, (said he,) I never was master of a pair of spurs, but once; and they are now at the bottom of the ocean. By the carelessness of Boswell’s servant, they were dropped from the end of the boat, on our return from the Isle of Sky [G-4].’ ”</p>
					<p>The late Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Samuel Badcock [G-5], having been introduced to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson, by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nichols, some years before his death, thus expressed himself in a letter to that gentleman:⁠—</p>
					<p>“How much I am obliged to you for the favour you did me in introducing me to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson! <i xml:lang="la">Tantùm vìdi Virgilium</i> [G-6]. But to have seen him, and to have received a testimony of respect from him, was enough. I recollect all the conversation, and shall never forget one of his expressions. Speaking of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> P⁠⸺ [Priestley], (whose writings, I saw, he estimated at a low rate,) he said, ‘You have proved him as deficient in <em>probity</em> as he is in learning [G-7].’ I called him an ‘Index-scholar [G-8];’ but he was not willing to allow him a claim even to that merit. He said, that ‘he borrowed from those who had been borrowers themselves, and did not know that the mistakes he adopted had been answered by others.’ I often think of our short, but precious, visit to this great man. I shall consider it as a kind of an <em>aera</em> in my life.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>.

Hawkins says, “at eleven, the evening of Johnson’s death, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Langton came to me, and in an agony of mind gave me to understand that our friend had wounded himself in several parts of the body.” Hawkins’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 590. To the dying man, “on the last day of his existence on this side the grave the desire of life,” to use Murphy’s words (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life</i>, page 135), “had returned with all its former vehemence.” In the hope of drawing off the dropsical water he gave himself these wounds (see <i>ante</i>, page 399). He lost a good deal of blood, and no doubt hastened his end. Langton must have suspected that Johnson intentionally shortened his life. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5497" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Burney wrote to the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> T. Twining on Christmas Day, 1784:⁠—“The Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey lay all the blame on Sir John Hawkins for suffering Johnson to be so unworthily interred. The Knight’s first inquiry at the Abbey in giving orders, as the most acting executor, was⁠—‘What would be the difference in the expense between a public and private funeral?’ and was told only a few pounds to the prebendaries, and about ninety pairs of gloves to the choir and attendants; and he then determined that, ‘as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson had no music in him, he should choose the cheapest manner of interment.’ And for this reason there was no organ heard, or burial service sung; for which he suffers the Dean and Chapter to be abused in all the newspapers, and joins in their abuse when the subject is mentioned in conversation.” Burney mentions a report that Hawkins had been slandering Johnson. <i>Recreations and Studies of a Country Clergyman of the <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span> Century</i>, page 129. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Charles Burney, jun., had written the day after the funeral:⁠—“The executor, Sir John Hawkins, did not manage things well, for there was no anthem or choir service performed⁠—no lesson⁠—but merely what is read over every old woman that is buried by the parish. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Taylor read the service but so-so.” Johnstone’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parr</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 535. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5500" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>On the subject of Johnson I may adopt the words of Sir John Harrington, concerning his venerable Tutor and Diocesan, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> John Still, Bishop of Bath and Wells; “who hath given me some helps, more hopes, all encouragements in my best studies: to whom I never came but I grew more religious; from whom I never went, but I parted better instructed.

I have introduced into this work several compliments paid to him in the writings of his contemporaries; but the number of them is so great, that we may fairly say that there was almost a general tribute.</p>
					<p>Let me not be forgetful of the honour done to him by Colonel Myddleton, of Gwaynynog, near Denbigh; who, on the banks of a rivulet in his park, where Johnson delighted to stand and repeat verses, erected an urn with the following inscription:</p>
					<p>“This spot was often dignified by the presence of <b epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Samuel Johnson</b>, LL.D. Whose moral writings, exactly conformable to the precepts of Christianity, Gave ardour to Virtue and confidence to Truth [H-1].”</p>
					<p>As no inconsiderable circumstance of his fame, we must reckon the extraordinary zeal of the artists to extend and perpetuate his image. I can enumerate a bust by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Nollekens, and the many casts which are made from it; several pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds, from one of which, in the possession of the Duke of Dorset, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Humphry executed a beautiful miniature in enamel; one by <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Frances Reynolds, Sir Joshua’s sister; one by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Zoffani; and one by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Opie [H-2]; and the following engravings of his portrait: 1. One by Cooke, from Sir Joshua, for the Proprietors’ edition of his folio <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dictionary</i>.⁠—2. One from ditto, by ditto, for their quarto edition.⁠—3.

This is one of the finest mezzotintos that ever was executed; and what renders it of extraordinary value, the plate was destroyed after four or five impressions only were taken off. One of them is in the possession of Sir William Scott [H-4]. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Townley has lately been prevailed with to execute and publish another of the same, that it may be more generally circulated among the admirers of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson.⁠—16. One large, from Sir Joshua’s first picture of him, by Heath, for this work, in quarto.⁠—17. One octavo, by Baker, for the octavo edition.⁠—18.

					<p>Though a perfect resemblance of Johnson is not to be found in any age, parts of his character are admirably expressed by Clarendon in drawing that of Lord Falkland, whom the noble and masterly historian describes at his seat near Oxford;⁠—“Such an immenseness of wit, such a solidity of judgement, so infinite a fancy, bound in by a most logical ratiocination.⁠—His acquaintance was cultivated by the most polite and accurate men, so that his house was an University in less volume, whither they came, not so much for repose as study, and to examine and refine those grosser propositions, which laziness and consent made current in conversation.”</p>
					<p>Bayle’s account of Ménage may also be quoted as exceedingly applicable to the great subject of this work:⁠—“His illustrious friends erected a very glorious monument to him in the collection entitled <i>Menagiana</i>. Those who judge of things aright, will confess that this collection is very proper to show the extent of genius and learning which was the character of Ménage. And I may be bold to say, that <em>the excellent works he published will not distinguish him from other learned men so advantageously as this</em>. To publish books of great learning, to make Greek and Latin verses exceedingly well turned, is not a common talent, I own; neither is it extremely rare, It is incomparably more difficult to find men who can furnish discourse about an infinite number of things, and who can diversify them an hundred ways. How many authors are there, who are admired for their works, on account of the vast learning that is displayed in them, who are not able to sustain a conversation. Those who know Ménage only by his books, might think he resembled those learned men; but if you show the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Menagiana</i>, you distinguish him from them, and make him known by a talent which is given to very few learned men. There it appears that he was a man who spoke offhand a thousand good things. His memory extended to what was ancient and modern; to the court and to the city; to the dead and to the living languages; to things serious and things jocose; in a word, to a thousand sorts of subjects. That which appeared a trifle to some readers of the <i>Menagiana</i>, who did not consider circumstances, caused admiration in other readers, who minded the difference between what a man speaks without preparation, and that which he prepares for the press. And, therefore, we cannot sufficiently commend the care which his illustrious friends took to erect a monument so capable of giving him immortal glory. They were not obliged to rectify what they had heard him say; for, in so doing, they had not been faithful historians of his conversations.” <cite>—Boswell</cite>. Boswell’s quotation from Clarendon (<abbr>ed.</abbr> 1826, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 242) differs somewhat from the original. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5524" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In Johnson’s character of Boerhaave there is much that applies equally well to himself. “Thus died Boerhaave, a man formed by nature for great designs, and guided by religion in the exertion of his abilities. He was of a robust and athletic constitution of body, so hardened by early severities and wholesome fatigue that he was insensible of any sharpness of air, or inclemency of weather. He was tall, and remarkable for extraordinary strength. There was in his air and motion something rough and artless, but so majestic and great at the same time, that no man ever looked upon him without veneration, and a kind of tacit submission to the superiority of his genius.⁠ ⁠… He was never soured by calumny and detraction, nor ever thought it necessary to confute them; ‘for they are sparks,’ said he, ‘which, if you do not blow them, will go out of themselves.’⁠ ⁠… He was not to be overawed or depressed by the presence, frowns, or insolence of great men; but persisted, on all occasions, in the right with a resolution always present and always calm.⁠ ⁠… Nor was he unacquainted with the art of recommending truth by elegance, and embellishing the philosopher with polite literature.⁠ ⁠… He knew the importance of his own writings to mankind, and lest he might by a roughness and barbarity of style, too frequent among men of great learning, disappoint his own intentions, and make his labours less useful, he did not neglect the politer arts of eloquence and poetry. Thus was his learning at once various and exact, profound and agreeable.⁠ ⁠… He asserted on all occasions the divine authority and sacred efficacy of the holy Scriptures; and maintained that they alone taught the way of salvation, and that they only could give peace of mind.” Johnson’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 288. <a href="part-4.xhtml#noteref-5528" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
