				<h4>“TO THE REV. DR. LELAND.</h4>
				<h5>“SIR,</h5>
				<p>“Among the names subscribed to the degree which I have had the honour of receiving from the university of Dublin, I find none of which I have any personal knowledge but those of Dr. Andrews and yourself.</p>
				<p>“Men can be estimated by those who know them not, only as they are represented by those who know them; and therefore I flatter myself that I owe much of the pleasure which this distinction gives me to your concurrence with Dr. Andrews in recommending me to the learned society.</p>
				<p>“Having desired the Provost to return my general thanks to the University, I beg that you, sir, will accept my particular and immediate acknowledgements.</p>
				<p>“I am, Sir,</p>
				<p>“Your most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
				<h5>“SAM. JOHNSON.”</h5>
				<p>“Johnson’s-court, Fleet-street,</p>
				<p>London, Oct. 17, 1765.”</p>
